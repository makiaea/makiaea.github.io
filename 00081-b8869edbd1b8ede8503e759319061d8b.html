<h2>zombies trolls lolcats</h2>
<h2>zombie to human</h2>
<ul>
<li>i hate creepy films because they are so similar to real life. you know how zombies are out to get you? they are like the abusive people in the world, the people who want to kill and eat you and infect you with their abuse so that you will kill and eat and abuse other people.</li>
<li>and if you're infected you may not realise you are a zombie and doing zombie things like eating people's brains. every so often someone who has been a zombie stops being a zombie and people call that enlightenment instead of just becoming human again. why don't they ever make films about zombies who become human again?</li>
<li>if you're lucky you are with a bunch if friends when you wake up one day and realise the world is now full if zombies. that's what they call learning about the real world.</li>
<li>if you're unlucky then some or maybe even all of your friends have been eaten or infected and you have a difficult time sorting out the undead from the living.</li>
<li>major bummer if you find out your best friends are more interested in your brains than they have any reason to be.</li>
<li>well in my case it wasn't until i woke up to find ariella dripping her blood onto new arrows that i had the first inkling i had been a zombie too.</li>
<li>i couldn't remember much. who i was, that kind of thing. you see, it's difficult to remember the awful things you did as a zombie, the mind kind of blocks them out. i'm told vampires have it easy.</li>
<li>so ariella says, &quot;what's up norm?&quot; and i know my name is norman.</li>
<li>you hear a lot about zombies infecting humans but you don't hear so much about humans infecting zombies to make them human again. that's because only the blood of someone with a pure heart can change them back.</li>
