<p><em>the mismeasure of ape social cognition</em><br />
david leavens et al. 2017</p>
<ul>
<li>In his classic analysis, Gould (The mismeasure of man, WW Norton, New York, <u>1981</u>) demolished the idea that intelligence was an inherent, genetic trait of different human groups by emphasizing, among other things, (a) its sensitivity to environmental input, (b) the incommensurate pre-test preparation of different human groups, and (c) the inadequacy of the testing contexts, in many cases. According to Gould, the root cause of these oversights was confirmation bias by psychometricians, an unwarranted commitment to the idea that intelligence was a fixed, immutable quality of people. By virtue of a similar, systemic interpretive bias, in the last two decades, numerous contemporary researchers in comparative psychology have claimed human superiority over apes in social intelligence, based on two-group comparisons between postindustrial, Western Europeans and captive apes, where the apes have been isolated from European styles of social interaction, and tested with radically different procedures. Moreover, direct comparisons of humans with apes suffer from pervasive lapses in argumentation: Research designs in wide contemporary use are inherently mute about the underlying psychological causes of overt behavior. Here we analyze these problems and offer a more fruitful approach to the comparative study of social intelligence, which focuses on specific individual learning histories in specific ecological circumstances.</li>

<p><em>washing away your sins: threatened morality and physical cleansing</em><br />
chen-bo zhong and katie liljenquist 2006<br />
http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1130726<br />
Link: <a href="http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1130726">doi.org/10.1126/science.1130726</a></p>
<ul>
<li>“Physical cleansing may wash away moral sins through symbolic self-completion (10); that is, people are motivated to complete their self-definitions (e.g., musicians) when indicators or symbols of this definition are lacking (e.g., skills) by engaging in activities that complete the symbols (e.g., training). Thus, when moral self-definition is at stake, such as when one has indulged in morally questionable activities, one should naturally be motivated to engage in activities that will restore moral integrity. For instance, Tetlock and colleagues (11) have shown that the mere contemplation of violating one’s core values spurs intent to take actions that will restore and protect those values. The restoration or completion of the moral self can be achieved through direct restitution, but it may also be achieved through substitutable symbols or activities that are not directly related (10, 11). Given the demonstrated association between physical cleansing and moral purity, cleansing activities that improve physical cleanliness may also compensate for moral impurity. Thus, we expected that a threat to the moral self would motivate the restoration of moral purity through direct compensatory behaviors (e.g., volunteering to help). If, however, physical cleansing restores the moral self, then individuals should have less need to engage in direct compensatory behaviors after physically cleansing themselves. This is indeed what we found. In Study 4, participants described an unethical deed from their past (the same recall task as in Study 1). Afterwards, they either cleansed their hands with an antiseptic wipe or not. Then they completed a survey regarding their current emotional state (9). After completing the survey, participants were asked if they would volunteer without pay for another research study to help out a desperate graduate student. Presumably, participants who had cleansed their hands before being solicited for help would be less motivated to volunteer because the sanitation wipes had already washed away their moral stains and restored a suitable moral self. As predicted, physical cleansing significant-ly reduced volunteerism: 74% of those in the not-cleansed condition offered help, whereas only 41% of participants who had a chance to cleanse their hands offered help (c2 0 5.02, P 0 0.025). Thus, the direct compensatory behavior (i.e., volunteering) dropped by almost 50% when participants had a chance to physically cleanse after recalling an unethical behavior.”</li>
<li>related to lakoff and johnson’s notion of “purity”<br />
<em>metaphors we live by</em><br />
lakoff, g., &amp; johnson, m. 1980</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Thus, the direct compensatory behavior (i.e., volunteering) dropped by almost 50% when participants had a chance to physically cleanse after recalling an unethical behavior.”</p>
<p>this is just wrong science. it should read “if participants cleansed after recalling an unethical behaviour, compared to those who did not cleanse, the likelihood of a number of participants accepting to volunteer was less, by 50%.”</p>
<p>this is important, because their phrasing implies each participant encountered both conditions, cleansed and not cleansed. they also lacked a control condition, where a different intervention is applied. this is understandable as their sample size is so small — max 23 for each condition, cleansed or uncleansed, so for a 50% difference, that is from 74% of 23 = 17 people offering help compared to 41% of 22 = 9 people. 8 people being more different in one measure just due to the extra not–controlled–for step, random chance or publication bias (good results published) rather than as the result of the experiment is easily within the bounds of possibility. the experiment needs repeating many times with better control conditions and many replications, including negative results, before the conclusions they express can be justified. moreover, even if their theory was correct, there is no direct correspondence between “volunteering” and “direct compensatory behaviour” — individual people may vary in their interpretation of whether volunteering counts towards compensating behaviour — the paper trumpets their conclusions based on sparse uncertain evidence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what is interesting to me in this study is those 26 of 55 people who accepted to volunteer, and especially those 9 people who the “cleansing” did not stop their accepting to help — is their moral compass stronger? we can’t tell from this data, but it is a question much more interesting to me</p>

<li>probability of precipitation
<ul>
<li>
<p>POP is the probability of exceedance that more than a certain amount of precipitation, e.g. 0.01 inches(USA NWS) or 0.1mm(UK MetOffice), will fall in a single spot, averaged over the forecast area. This can be expressed mathematically:</p>
<p><em>PoP = C x A</em></p>
<p>C = the confidence that precipitation will occur somewhere in the forecast area.<br />
A = the percent of the area that will receive measurable precipitation, if it occurs at all.<br />
For instance, if there is a 100% probability of rain covering one half of a city, and a 0% probability of rain on the other half of the city, the POP for the city would be 50%. A 50% chance of a rainstorm covering the entire city would also lead to a POP of 50%. The POP thus usually expresses a combination of degree of confidence and geographic coverage.</p>
<p>Note that the POP measure is meaningless unless it is associated with a period of time. NWS forecasts commonly use POP defined over 12-hour periods (POP12), though 6-hour periods (POP6) and other measures are also published. A &quot;daytime&quot; POP12 means from 6 am to 6 pm.<a href="https://charleseisenstein.org/books/the-more-beautiful-world-our-hearts-know-is-possible/eng/separation/">2</a><br />

george reisch, gary hardcastle eds 2006</p>
<ul>
<li>mistakes bullshit for politeness, believes politeness is untruth</li>
<li>we are different from people who believe that lying is a necessary part of life, because we understand and do really feel sorry rather than faking an apology, actually apply principles rather than faking a belief in them etc.</li>

<ul>
<li>we are blessed and cursed at the same time. by being able to see through some of the illusions that flow round us. through false illusions and false comfort. to love dearly with all our hearts yet to be forever apart.
<ul>
<li>the reason we seem to be different from the norm is that we do not believe in the sanctity of what they tell us. so we are often closer to reality than their static descriptions of things–as–they–may–have–been.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>being acutely aware and at the same time being easygoing may seem impossible, but it is actually possible, and is actually much easier than is generally believed</li>
<li>&quot;to lie it in&quot; — use a lie to make something happen, e.g. tony blair and iraq war, george w. bush and u.s. presidency. c.f. &quot;to swear in&quot;.</li>
<li>hallelulie — v. to use lie in religious argument to manipulate public opinion.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>most people think they don't form an attachment to a place or person until they have shared many moments and memories together. but like many things we believe, this isn't often true.</li>
</ul>
<h2>04796</h2>
<ul>
<li>life on earth is just a fragile thin layer, like neocortex. may seem permanent like civilisation but actually ephemeral.</li>
<li>the problem with economists’ “sunk cost” is that it is about money and not about resources. wasted resources have an environmental cost which we need to understand if we want to make decisions based in reality</li>
</ul>
<h2>04696</h2>
<ul>
<li>assuming that just because something is common and negative, that we should also feel negative. example: abusive behaviour. this is because we assume what we know is true, and that it will continue to be true — the denial of change.</li>
</ul>
<h2>04596</h2>
<ul>
<li>we may believe our lives are full of logic or reason, but viscerally we know this is not as we believe.</li>
<li>reasons are bullshit: “we need reasons so we appear reasonable, yet when we use reasons we are not taking full responsibility for our behavior.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>04496</h2>
<ul>
<li>just because some things we observe seem incorrect, does not imply that all things we think are incorrect are actually incorrect.</li>
</ul>
<h2>04396</h2>
<ul>
<li>by their very nature, the most difficult problems are those at which we are most likely to fail. not the most severe, or even the most common, but those where there are more opportunities for us to make mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>04296</h2>
<ul>
<li>i don't believe in the &quot;10000 hours to mastery&quot; meme because it is a myth. yes there are people who have spent ten thousand hours towards some things but that does not mean that all people need to spend ten thousand hours in the same way, or that they must do so. that is another old spell, the spell of specialisation, dedication and concentration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>04196</h2>
<ul>
<li>misusing kuhn’s paradigm model, we could say that paradigms must necessarily exist by definition because for a paradigm to exist then most people (at some point) must not understand the issue, and so there is a paradigm to overturn, <em>ad infinitum</em>.</li>

tell me, baby, do you recognize me?<br />
well, it’s been a year, it doesn’t surprise me</p>
<p>merry christmas, i wrapped it up and sent it<br />
with a note saying, “i love you”, i meant it<br />
now i know what a fool i’ve been<br />
but if you kissed me now i know you’d fool me again</p>
<p>☆repeat x2</p>
<p>a crowded room and friends with tired eyes<br />
i’m hiding from you and your soul of ice<br />
my god, i thought you were someone to rely on<br />
me? i guess i was a shoulder to cry on</p>
<p>a face on a lover with a fire in his heart<br />
a girl undercover but you tore her apart<br />
maybe this year, maybe this year<br />
i’ll give it to someone special<br />

<li>chicken–and–egg problems are actually very common, we just don’t know it because we don’t fully understand the issues involved.

<li>science unfortunately is not able to give much guidance on things like how thinking &quot;I have such and such disease or ailment&quot; increases the very likelihood of that occurrence — not by some mystical power but just by reinforcing the very conditions that lead to the symptoms of our arbitrary definition of that condition. it is a reinforcement of our definition rather than a reinforcement of fact.</li>

<h2>03396</h2>
<ul>
<li>in a distorted and distorting society we can expect that concepts go astray. a doctor is meant to heal, a religion meant to be how to live a good life together, a school is meant to help people learn, leaders are meant to show the right path for all. but many concepts like these have been corrupted to become paths to power for abusive people.</li>

<ul>
<li>regression to the mean is useful only if you are thinking in one dimension. there is no use worrying if your child will be as smart as you because in all likelihood they will be smart in a different way. but if you are just thinking in one dimension, for example number of accidents before and after installing speed cameras in chosen locations (and those locations are chosen by how bad or frequent accidents are) then if we do not take into account regression to the mean then we are very likely to overestimate the impact of our so called intervention.</li>
</ul>
<h2>02596</h2>
<ul>
<li>the reason we are so resilient, and why abusers are so fragile, is the same — our relation to reality. an abuser’s life is far from reality, so when their illusions are unmasked there is reckoning to pay. we are still far from reality, just not as far as an abuser is, so shocks have less effect on us as there is less perceptual distance to fall</li>
</ul>
<h2>02496</h2>
<ul>
<li>am slowly coming to the conclusion we are all insane — not more or less, just rather in different ways
<ul>
<li>sanity is a myth</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>02396</h2>
<ul>
<li>generalisations are illusory knowledge, like much of our so–called knowledge it seems to work most of the time — at present. it may be that most of our knowledge is this illusory kind — we would do well to understand this</li>
</ul>
<h2>02296</h2>
<ul>
<li>life not zero sum
<ul>
<li>don't have to lose so someone else can win</li>
<li>the world of not zero sum. just because someone cannot see your worth does not mean you are worthless. just because someone else got the opportunity you wanted does not mean that you have lost. the time you used may be gone but you have gained and learned from the experience and possibly also from the relationship you have created.</li>

<li>instead of seeing what is there, we mostly see what we want to see, what we expect to see, what the story leads us to believe we should see.</li>
</ul>
<h2>01896</h2>
<ul>
<li>purity, perfection are myths, and if you want to go that far, so too are independence, fate, belief, necessity, power, values, words, and myth itself. that doesn't mean they are any less important, in some ways we should be striving for more of each myth, not less.
<ul>
<li>memories and habits are spells, as are words and songs and stories and science and myth.</li>
<li>so–called perfection is satisficing at a high level</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>not perfection doesn't seek to preserve. perfection made as a tool to control and manipulate others, for there is no reason to submit.</li>
<li>the only escape from tyrants who manipulate our beliefs is to discard our reliance on beliefs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>01796</h2>
<ul>
<li>things are rarely what we think they are
<ul>
<li>but that is okay unless we insist that what we think is really how things are</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>01696</h2>
<ul>
<li>reality is different to what most of society tells us. not so different that we can never reach it —yet what they tell us is sufficiently misleading that as long as we believe it, we will not.</li>
</ul>
<h2>01596</h2>
<ul>
<li>the issue is not that people are wrong — we are all wrong much of the time and unaware of it… the issue is given this fact, what do we do? one answer is to often review our assumptions, to try to make assumptions that are less wrong.</li>
</ul>
<h2>01496</h2>
<ul>
<li>causation defines our speech because it is used to define words — it is circular. we define things by what they do but what they do is dependent on causality</li>
</ul>
<h2>01396</h2>
<ul>
<li>Illusion as what is left when description does not match reality, when a map does not match the territory. So anything can become illusory when the reality it means to describe undergoes change or otherwise no longer matches the description. Accuracy of information is the degree to which it matches reality or the degree to which it minimises illusion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>01296</h2>
<ul>
<li>mistake militancy for drive, drive for devotion, devotion for righteousness, righteousness for right</li>
<li>mistake mistakes for weakness, weakness for useless, useless for worthless, worthless for bad, bad for evil, evil for wrong</li>
<li>Good and Evil are illusions. You will probably already be able to understand why this is.</li>
<li>Dichotomies are bad because restricting dialogue to two theories, rather than accepting full reality, is not a simplification, it is a falsehood.
<ul>
<li>We should revisit binary decisions. They may not be truly binary anymore, and may never have been so.</li>

<h2>00596</h2>
<ul>
<li>illusion of value
<ul>
<li>does truth exist? or is it an illusion too? diversity may be only observable fact.</li>
<li>so there wasn't a time when we knew that things were true and when things were not.</li>
<li>we must experience the search for truth before we can appreciate that there is no real truth that can be found — otherwise we are unlikely to believe such a thing. “the way that can be described is not the way”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>00396</h2>
<ul>
<li>“protective” delusion
<ul>
<li>delusions are protective, they insulate people from harsh realities that they would otherwise be unable to bear. if you wish to remove your delusions, you also need to prepare yourself to face realities that are harsher than you presently understand.</li>
<li>the fact of the matter is, the truth hurts. not because it is inherently painful, but because we are living in denial of reality and to face reality suddenly is shocking.</li>
<li>the problem with trying to discuss what reality is with most people is that rather than face reality they instead defend their assumptions based on the belief that they personally will be without worth if their assumptions, upon which they based their lives, are wrong.</li>
<li>they behave as if their lives depend on being right — and in a way, they do. any tribe that did not cohere seemed to be outgrown by those that did. laying aside whether that was real, this time growing itself is the problem — our beliefs have led us to outgrow our planet’s ability to indulge us.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>00496</h2>
<ul>
<li>illusion of belief, eternity, certainty, perfection, righteousness, truth
<ul>
<li>anyone who doesn’t learn how the world really works is bound to be chained by their beliefs of how the world works</li>
<li>the human world is an illusion of belief. everything built on an illusion will fall. faiths, science, nations, institutions.</li>
<li>there are always those who take words or other things too literally, fundamentalists, because they do not understand that words, all things, are not perfect — in a sense they are not as real as we imagine them to be, they are an illusory reality. literal understandings of “the world is an illusion” are sometimes unhelpful, because although we world in our understand is an illusion, the world itself is not an illusion — only our understanding of it is an illusion.</li>
<li>enemy is false word, thought, belief. but how does the enemy come to be? false belief in eternal rather than change leads us to think there can be a path that never changes, never grows, never dies. our enemy is our belief in an eternal.</li>
<li>when you believe you are right, that is precisely the point when you have already fallen into a trap — because there is no absolute right, and so to believe so is to be wrong. right and wrong are not opposites, because right does not exist. to start believing you are right, you have started to fail to maintain connection with reality, where there is no absolute right. there is only a changing reality, and to maintain connection with it is to be temporarily not–wrong.</li>
<li>if a belief system aspires to meet changing reality, there is no avoiding this core understanding, which is why we find this deep at the centre of each viable system.</li>
<li>just because most people “prefer” to deny this, does not make it less real. the “denial” is an illusion that it is easier or better not to try to understand the reality of whether the belief system aspires to meet changing reality, and the so–called “preference” arises from this illusion. some might want you to believe that it is hard to face a changing reality, but actually we can flow with reality easily — it is the illusion of “truth” that keeps us from flowing with reality.</li>
<li>all the same, we need to bear in mind that, at any given time, most people are under the spell of this illusion, and knowing this makes it easier to understand how they will act — and how we will act when we come under that spell. this points the way out — if we know there will be times when we will be under the spell, we can make some preparations to help us break free, and otherwise lessen the consequences of our time while we are bound. the most helpful (but hard–to–understand) concept i have come across so far is “diversity”.</li>
<li>and because this concept of “diversity” is so helpful in dealing with the consequences of this core illusion, the concept of “diversity” also is at the core of belief systems which aspire to meet changing reality.</li>

<p>once we understand stochastic nature of reality, understand that diversity is one of few practical methods to face reality, most others are illusions</p>

<li>in terms of relation to reality, the class of concepts containing change, evolution, and diversity is “more true” than any class of static concepts. they are all still illusions, just slightly “better” illusions than the static ones.</li>

<p>when something appears to work, we value it higher and will do it again if the occasion arises. this is how our beliefs calcify as we grow older. the problem is that little concept: the “appears” in “appears to work”. although something can appear to work, often it does not truly work, or not as we believe it does. and in general, life moves on, the world changes, and even things that did truly work will eventually no longer do so. The “appears” is at the heart of what some call illusion, karma, destiny, fate. if we can understand why “appears” is so important, we can change the direction of our lives.</p>

<h1><em>perceptual decisions are biased by the cost to act</em></h1>
<p>nobuhiro hagura, patrick haggard jörn diedrichsen 2017<br />

<h2>Perceptual decisions are classically thought to depend mainly on the stimulus characteristics, probability and associated reward. However, in many cases, the motor response is considered to be a neutral output channel that only reflects the upstream decision. Contrary to this view, we show that perceptual decisions can be recursively influenced by the physical resistance applied to the response. When participants reported the direction of the visual motion by left or right manual reaching movement with different resistances, their reports were biased towards the direction associated with less effortful option. Repeated exposure to such resistance on hand during perceptual judgements also biased subsequent judgements using voice, indicating that effector-dependent motor costs not only biases the report at the stage of motor response, but also changed how the sensory inputs are transformed into decisions. This demonstrates that the cost to act can influence our decisions beyond the context of the specific action.</h2>
