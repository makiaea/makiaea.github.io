<p><em>environmental and social footprints of international trade</em><br />
thomas wiedmann, manfred lenzen 2018<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-018-0113-9">doi.org/10.1038/s41561-018-0113-9</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Globalization has led to an increasing geospatial separation of production and consumption, and, as a consequence, to an unprecedented displacement of environmental and social impacts through international trade. A large proportion of total global impacts can be associated with trade, and the trend is rising. Advances in global multi-region input-output models have allowed researchers to draw detailed, international supply-chain connections between harmful production in social and environmental hotspots and affluent consumption in global centres of wealth. The general direction of impact displacement is from developed to developing countries—an increase of health impacts in China from air pollution linked to export production for the United States being one prominent example. The relocation of production across countries counteracts national mitigation policies and may negate ostensible achievements in decoupling impacts from economic growth. A comprehensive implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals therefore requires the inclusion of footprint indicators to avoid loopholes in national sustainability assessments.</li>

<p><em>collaborative consumption: strategic and economic implications of product sharing</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Recent technological advances in online and mobile communications have enabled collaborative consumption or product sharing among consumers on a massive scale. Collaborative consumption has emerged as a major trend as the global economic recession and social concerns about consumption sustainability lead consumers and society as a whole to explore more efficient use of resources and products. We develop an analytical framework to examine the strategic and economic impact of product sharing among consumers. A consumer who purchased a firm’s product can derive different usage values across different usage periods. In a period with low self-use value, the consumer may generate some income by renting out her purchased product through a third-party sharing platform as long as the rental fee net of transaction costs exceeds her own self-use value. Our analysis shows that transaction costs in the sharing market have a non-monotonic effect on the firm’s profits, consumer surplus, and social welfare. We find that when the firm strategically chooses its retail price, consumers’ sharing of products with high marginal costs is win-win for the firm and the consumers whereas their sharing of products with low marginal costs can be lose-lose. Further, in the presence of the sharing market, the firm will find it optimal to strategically increase its quality, leading to higher profits but lower consumer surplus.</li>

<p><em>macroeconomic impact of stranded fossil fuel assets</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Several major economies rely heavily on fossil fuel production and exports, yet current low-carbon technology diffusion, energy efficiency and climate policy may be substantially reducing global demand for fossil fuels1,2,3,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0182-1#ref-CR4">4</a>. This trend is inconsistent with observed investment in new fossil fuel ventures<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0182-1#ref-CR1">2</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0182-1#ref-CR2">3</a>, which could become stranded as a result. Here, we use an integrated global economy–environment simulation model to study the macroeconomic impact of stranded fossil fuel assets (SFFA). Our analysis suggests that part of the SFFA would occur as a result of an already ongoing technological trajectory, irrespective of whether or not new climate policies are adopted; the loss would be amplified if new climate policies to reach the 2 °C target of the Paris Agreement are adopted and/or if low-cost producers (some OPEC countries) maintain their level of production (‘sell out’) despite declining demand; the magnitude of the loss from SFFA may amount to a discounted global wealth loss of US$1–4 trillion; and there are clear distributional impacts, with winners (for example, net importers such as China or the EU) and losers (for example, Russia, the United States or Canada, which could see their fossil fuel industries nearly shut down), although the two effects would largely offset each other at the level of aggregate global GDP.</li>

<p>in comparison to most people who spend often, i seem frugal — i spend large amounts only on items i will often use or use long–term (“opportunity cost”), and tend not to spend otherwise (even after windfalls etc.). if they use mental “category budgeting” to justify their expenditure, then we spend very differently because they can only justify spending in their own way, not through opportunity cost.</p>

</li>

<p>“If we compared everything to all other things, we would consider our opportunity costs and all would be well. But we don’t. We compare the item to only one other (sometimes two)”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“When we have no idea what something should cost, we believe we’re making the best decision if we neither overspend on the deluxe model nor go too cheap on the basic one. So we opt for the middle one … a choice made for reasons that have little to do with true value.”</p>

“we base our decisions not on those of other people, but on similar decisions we ourselves have made in the past. We assume something has high value because we valued it highly before. We value something at what it “normally” or has “always” cost, because we trust ourselves with our own behaviors. We remember that we’ve made a specific value decision over and over, so, without spending the time and energy to evaluate that decision over and over, we assume it was a good one. After all, we are fantastic decision makers, so if we made that decision before, it has to be the best, most well reasoned one.”</p>

<p><em>anchoring and arbitrary coherence</em><br />
“the random starting points, and the subsequent pattern of valuations that began with these anchors, created an illusion of order”</p>
<p>“we gain insight—sometimes humbling insight, but still—only from decisions about which we’re conscious. We don’t ever get to doubt decisions that we make unconsciously, that we don’t pay attention to, that we’ve forgotten, or those we’ve been using thoughtlessly forever as a foundation for our lives.”</p>
<p>“That we are so easily and unconsciously swayed by a suggested price—by an anchor—should reinforce how hard it is to assess value”</p>

<li>The European debt crisis is not a conflict among nations. All economic systems— and certainly an entity as large and diverse as Europe— generate volatility whose balance sheet impacts are mediated through different political and economic institutions, among which usually are domestic monetary policy and the currency regime. With the creation of the euro as the common currency among a group of European countries, monetary policy and the currency regime could no longer play their traditional roles in absorbing economic volatility. As a result, for much of the euro’s first decade, a series of deep imbalances developed among various sectors of the European economy. Because Europe’s existing economic and political institutions had largely evolved around the national sovereignty of individual countries, and also because the inflation and monetary histories of individual countries varied tremendously before the creation of the euro, it was probably almost inevitable that these imbalances would manifest themselves in the form of trade and capital flow imbalances between countries.</li>

“[The man of system] seems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great society with as much ease as the hand arranges the different pieces upon a chessboard. He does not consider that the pieces upon the chessboard have no other principle of motion besides that which the hand impresses upon them; but that, in the great chessboard of human society, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own, altogether different from that which the legislature might choose to impress upon it. If those two principles coincide and act in the same direction, the game of human society will go on easily and harmoniously, and is very likely to be happy and successful. If they are opposite or different, the game will go on miserably, and the society must be at all times in the highest degree of disorder.”</li>

<li>The free-rider behavior is widespread in the system, which will not only lead to social dilemma, and even make the entire system collapse. In order to overcome this complex problem, scientists have done a strenuous endeavor. The public goods game is significant for the study of cooperative behavior among complex interactive social system. And much attention has been paid to the proposal of reward and punishment system. Although people always want to reward cooperative behavior in many cases, antisocial behavior is also common in complex human and biological communities, and free-riders may be rewarded, especially without their information. Therefore, we study the public good game with neutral reward in order to explore the evolution of cooperation. In our public good game, individuals with a few strategies reward other individuals with most strategies in a same group, and the dominant players will receive a fixed bonus provide by other vulnerable players. We show that increasing the bonus will directly promote cooperation and resolve the social dilemma.</li>

<li>monetary values are insufficient information — we must take into account their vector, from where they come and where they go. money is scalar but value is vector.</li>
<li>in pensions and other schemes like stocks, what you put in is not what you get out. this is the basic wrong assumption. there is no equivalence, even in the special case where the values are monetarily the same. instead, what you get out is coming from others who have put in after you, because what you put in has already been taken out by those leaving before you. thus the second assumption is that there will be people after you to join the scheme. these two assumptions are very often disastrous because they lead to the belief that the scheme will continue, when it is very likely to end — and ruin many lives in the process.</li>
