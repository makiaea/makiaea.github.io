<p><em>indigenous knowledge networks in the face of global change</em><br />
rodrigo cámara-leret et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1821843116">http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1821843116</a></p>

<p>Plants play an important role for most indigenous communities in South America, and not merely as a source of food. They also provide the raw material for building materials, tools, medicine, and much more. The extinction of a plant species therefore also endangers the very foundation of these people's way of life.</p>
<p>But there is another threat that has more or less gone unnoticed: The disappearance of the knowledge of what the different plant species are used for. The problem is that this is not written down. Passed down as a cultural inheritance, it exists only in the minds of the people -- and could therefore vanish almost unnoticed. &quot;Very little is known about how vulnerable this knowledge is in the context of current global change,&quot; says Jordi Bascompte, professor of ecology at the University of Zurich. &quot;There is therefore an urgent need to find out how biological and cultural factors interact with each other in determining the services provided by biodiversity..&quot;</p>
<p>Analysis of the use of palm trees</p>
<p>Consequently, Jordi Bascompte and his postdoc Miguel A. Fortuna teamed up with Rodrigo Cámara-Leret from the Royal Botanic Gardens in the UK to study these interactions on a large scale for the first time. For their study, they analyzed knowledge held by 57 indigenous communities in the Amazon basin, the Andes and the Chocó region to collate their knowledge of palm trees. The researchers then depicted the different palm species and their uses in graphical form in a network, from which they could identify the local and regional links between the knowledge of indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Each community knew around 18 palm species and 36 different possible uses on average. For example, the fruit is eaten, dried leaves are woven into hammocks and the trunks can be split and laid as flooring in huts. The study revealed that the knowledge of the different communities only overlapped partially, even with respect to the same species of palm.</p>
<p>Minimal loss of knowledge still has consequences</p>
<p>Using simulations, the researchers analyzed what would happen if knowledge of a particular species or use were lost. They found that the network is extremely fragile, with the loss of just a few components having the potential to make an enormous impact on the entire system: &quot;In this context, cultural diversity is just as important as biological diversity,&quot; says Jordi Bascompte. &quot;In particular, the simultaneous loss of plant species and cultural inheritance leads to a much faster disintegration of the indigenous knowledge network.&quot;</p>
<p>Importance of cultural and biological factors</p>
<p>Bascompte and his colleagues concluded that, to date, too little attention has been paid to cultural factors. &quot;The focus is typically directed toward the extinction of plant species. However, the irreplaceable knowledge that is gradually disappearing from indigenous communities is equally important for the service that an ecosystem provides.&quot;</p>
<p>The study also highlights the value of transdisciplinary collaboration between ecology and social science: &quot;The relationship established between biological and cultural diversity can help strengthen the resilience of indigenous communities in the face of global change.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> The knowledge of nonliterate societies may vanish in silence jeopardizing indigenous peoples’ livelihoods. Yet, this cultural component is missed by studies on ecosystem services that have historically emphasized the biological dimension. Here we fill this gap by introducing indigenous knowledge networks representing the wisdom of indigenous people on plant species and the services they provide. This approach allows us to assess how knowledge held by 57 Neotropical indigenous communities is structured locally and regionally, how it is influenced by turnover in biological and cultural heritage, and how the progressive loss of biocultural heritage may undermine the resilience of these communities.</p>
<p>Indigenous communities rely extensively on plants for food, shelter, and medicine. It is still unknown, however, to what degree their survival is jeopardized by the loss of either plant species or knowledge about their services. To fill this gap, here we introduce indigenous knowledge networks describing the wisdom of indigenous people on plant species and the services they provide. Our results across 57 Neotropical communities show that cultural heritage is as important as plants for preserving indigenous knowledge both locally and regionally. Indeed, knowledge networks collapse as fast when plant species are driven extinct as when cultural diffusion, either within or among communities, is lost. But it is the joint loss of plant species and knowledge that erodes these networks at a much higher rate. Our findings pave the road toward integrative policies that recognize more explicitly the inseparable links between cultural and biological heritage.</p>

<p><em>adaptive flexibility in category learning? young children exhibit smaller costs of selective attention than adults</em><br />
blanco, n. j., &amp; sloutsky, v. m. et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/dev0000777">http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/dev0000777</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Previous research has shown that when learning categories, adults and young children allocate attention differently. Adults tend to attend selectively, focusing primarily on the most relevant information, whereas young children tend to distribute their attention broadly. Although selective attention is useful in many situations, it also has costs. In addition to ignoring information that may turn out to be useful later, selective attention can have long-term costs, such as learned inattention—ignoring formerly irrelevant sources of information in novel situations. In 2 reported experiments, adults and 4-year-old children completed a category learning task in which an unannounced shift occurred such that information that was most relevant became irrelevant, whereas formerly irrelevant information became relevant. Costs stemming from this shift were assessed. The results indicate that adults exhibit greater costs due to learned inattention than young children. Distributing attention may be adaptive in young children, making them flexible to changing contingencies in the world and facilitating broad information gathering, both of which are useful when general knowledge about the environment is limited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Researchers surprised adults and 4- and 5-year-old children participating in the study by making information that was irrelevant at the beginning of the experiment suddenly important for a task they had to complete.</p>
<p>&quot;Adults had a hard time readjusting because they didn't learn the information they thought wouldn't be important,&quot; said Vladimir Sloutsky, co-author of the study and professor of psychology at The Ohio State University.</p>
<p>&quot;Children, on the other hand, recovered quickly to the new circumstances because they weren't ignoring anything. I'm sure a lot of parents will recognize that tendency of children to notice everything, even when you wish they wouldn't.&quot;</p>
<p>Sloutsky conducted the study with Nathaniel Blanco, a postdoctoral researcher in psychology at Ohio State. Their research was published online in the journal Developmental Psychology and will appear in a future print edition.</p>
<p>The results show that children tend to distribute their attention broadly, while adults use selective attention to focus on information they believe is most important, Sloutsky said.</p>
<p>&quot;Distributing attention may be adaptive for young children. By being attentive to everything, they gather more information which helps them learn more,&quot; Blanco said.</p>
<p>In one study, the researchers had 34 adults and 36 4-year-old children take part in a learning task.</p>
<p>They were presented with colorful images of &quot;alien&quot; creatures on a computer that had seven identifiable features, including antennae, head and tail.</p>
<p>Participants were told there were two types of creatures, called Flurps and Jalets, and that they had to figure out which ones were which.</p>
<p>One feature was always different on Flurps and Jalets -- for example, the Jalets may have a blue tail and the Flurps an orange tail. In addition, the children and adults were told that most (but not all) of the Flurps had a certain type of feature, such as pink antennae.</p>
<p>One of the features was never mentioned in the instructions and it did not differ between the types of creatures. This was what the researchers called the &quot;irrelevant feature.&quot;</p>
<p>After training, participants were shown a series of images of the creatures on the computer screen and indicated whether each one was a Flurp or a Jalet.</p>
<p>But halfway through the experiment, the researchers made an unannounced switch: The irrelevant feature became the feature that would determine whether the creature was a Flurp or a Jalet. This feature, which had been the same for both creatures before the switch, was now different.</p>
<p>After the shift, the adults were more confused than the children were -- they were less likely to learn the importance of the new feature.</p>
<p>In contrast, children were quick to realize that the formerly irrelevant feature was now the feature that would always reveal the difference between Flurps and Jalets.</p>
<p>Adults tried to use the probabilistic rules (such as &quot;most of the Flurps have pink antennae&quot;) to guide their choices after the shift.</p>
<p>In this study, adults suffered from &quot;learned inattention,&quot; Blanco said. They didn't pay attention to the formerly irrelevant feature because they believed it wouldn't be important.</p>
<p>Children as young as those in this study often have difficulty focusing attention in the way that the adults did, Sloutsky said.</p>
<p>&quot;The immediate reason is the immaturity of their pre-frontal cortex,&quot; he said. &quot;But we believe that distributing attention broadly also helps them learn more.&quot;</p>
<p>Sloutsky emphasized that adults have no problem distributing attention broadly if necessary. But in many tasks that adults do every day, selective attention is helpful.</p>

<li>• The more important the paper, the more people who should review it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step #7. Write Without the Agony
<ul>
<li>• Follow your outline and articulate your points clearly.</li>
<li>• Write no more than three to five pages per weekday and five to eight pages per weekend day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step #8. Fix, Don't Fixate
<ul>
<li>• Solid editing requires only three careful passes:</li>
<li>– The Argument Adjustment Pass: Read the paper carefully on your computer to make sure your argument is clear, fix obvious errors, and rewrite where the flow needs improvement.</li>
<li>– The Out Loud Pass: Carefully read out loud a printed copy of your paper, marking any awkward passages or unclear explanations.</li>
<li>– The Sanity Pass: A final pass over a printed version of the paper to check the overall flow and to root out any remaining errors.</li>

<li>Climate change, predatory capitalism and religious fundamentalism really are only ‘surface’ phenomena, because the human actions leading to them are determined by the deep structure of our minds, the functional architecture of our culturally embedded brains. The real challenge is not climate change as such; the true problems humankind must confront are the inbuilt features of our very own minds, such as systematic rationality and empathy deficits, self-deception, and the extreme vulnerability of the inner mechanisms creating mental autonomy.</li>
<li>This process of learning about ourselves is emotionally unattractive to many. It forces us to confront centuries-old systems of systematic self-deception, often represented by certain forms of organised religion. Indeed, one of the interesting aspects of mental autonomy is our general inability to notice when we lack it. Not only does there seem to be a widespread form of ‘introspective neglect’ related to the losses of cognitive self-control characterising our inner life, resembling a form of anosognosia or anosodiaphoria (as in patients unable to become aware of, or who remain indifferent to, the existence of a disability, such as the fact that their left arm is paralysed). The phenomenon of mind-wandering itself is also clearly related to denial and confabulation. Introspective experience and the verbal reports of one’s own inner life are probably likely to be distorted by overconfidence bias regarding the degree to which one actually is in control, by illusions of superiority and introspection illusion (in which we falsely assume direct insight into the origins of our mental states, while treating others’ introspections as unreliable).</li>
<li>What is clear by now is that our societies lack systematic and institutionalised ways of enhancing citizens’ mental autonomy. This is a neglected duty of care on the part of governments. There can be no politically mature citizens without a sufficient degree of mental autonomy, but society as a whole does not act to protect or increase it. Yet, it might be the most precious resource of all. In the end, and in the face of serious existential risks posed by environmental degradation and advanced capitalism, we must understand that citizens’ collective level of mental autonomy will be the decisive factor.</li>
<li>It was William James, the father of American psychology, who said in 1892: ‘And the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again is the very root of judgment, character, and will. […] And education which should improve this faculty would be <em>the</em> education <em>par excellence</em>.’ We can finally see more clearly what meditation is really about: over the centuries, the main goal has always been a sustained enhancement of one’s mental autonomy.</li>

<p><em>measuring actual learning versus feeling of learning in response to being actively engaged in the classroom</em><br />
louis deslauriers et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1821936116">doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1821936116</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>though students felt like they learned more through traditional lectures, they actually learned more when taking part in active learning classrooms.</p>
<p>The lead author Louis Deslauriers, Director of Science Teaching and Learning and senior Physics preceptor, knew that students would learn more from active learning. He published a key study in Science in 2011 that showed just that. But many students and faculty remained hesitant to switch to active learning.</p>
<p>&quot;Often, students seemed genuinely to prefer smooth-as-silk traditional lectures,&quot; Deslauriers said. &quot;We wanted to take them at their word. Perhaps they actually felt like they learned more from lectures than they did from active learning.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to Deslauriers, the study is authored by Director of Science Education and Lecturer on Physics Logan McCarty, senior preceptor in Applied Physics Kelly Miller, preceptor in Physics Greg Kestin, and Kristina Callaghan, now a lecturer in Physics at the University of California, Merced.</p>
<p>The question of whether students' perceptions of their learning matches with their actual learning is particularly important, Deslauriers said, because though students eventually see the value of active learning, it can initially feel frustrating.</p>
<p>&quot;Deep learning is hard work. The effort involved in active learning can be misinterpreted as a sign of poor learning,&quot; he said. &quot;On the other hand, a superstar lecturer can explain things in such a way as to make students feel like they are learning more than they actually are.&quot;</p>
<p>To understand that dichotomy, Deslauriers and his co-authors designed an experiment that would expose students in an introductory physics class to both traditional lectures and active learning.</p>
<p>For the first 11 weeks of the 15-week class, students were taught using standard methods by an experienced instructor. In the 12th week, though, things changed -- half the class was randomly assigned to a classroom that used active learning, while the other half attended highly polished lectures. In a subsequent class, the two groups were reversed. Notably, both groups used identical class content and only active engagement with the material was toggled on and off.</p>
<p>Following each class, students were surveyed on how much they agreed or disagreed with statements like &quot;I feel like I learned a lot from this lecture&quot; and &quot;I wish all my physics courses were taught this way.&quot; Students were also tested on how much they learned in the class with 12 multiple choice questions.</p>
<p>When the results were tallied, the authors found that students felt like they learned more from the lectures, but in fact scored higher on tests following the active learning sessions.</p>
<p>&quot;Actual learning and feeling of learning were strongly anticorrelated,&quot; Deslauriers said, &quot;as shown through the robust statistical analysis by co-author Kelly Miller, who is an expert in educational statistics and active learning.&quot;</p>
<p>But those results, the study authors warned, shouldn't be interpreted as suggesting students dislike active learning. In fact many studies have shown students quickly warm to the idea, once they begin to see the results.</p>
<p>&quot;In all the courses at Harvard that we've transformed to active learning,&quot; Deslauriers said, &quot;the overall course evaluations went up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It can be tempting to engage the class simply by folding lectures into a compelling 'story,' especially when that's what students seem to like,&quot; said Kestin, a co-author of the study, who is a physicist and a video producer with NOVA | PBS. &quot;I show my students the data from this study on the first day of class to help them appreciate the importance of their own involvement in active learning.&quot;</p>
<p>McCarty, who oversees curricular efforts across the sciences, hopes this study will encourage more faculty colleagues to use active learning in their courses.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to make sure that other instructors are thinking hard about the way they're teaching,&quot; he said. &quot;In our classes, we start each topic by asking students to gather in small groups to solve some problems. While they work, we walk around the room to observe them and answer questions. Then we come together and give a short lecture targeted specifically at the misconceptions and struggles we saw during the problem-solving activity. So far we've transformed over a dozen classes to use this kind of active learning approach. It's extremely efficient -- we can cover just as much material as we would using lectures.&quot;</p>
<p>A pioneer in work on active learning, Professor of Physics Eric Mazur hailed the study as debunking long-held beliefs about how students learn.</p>
<p>&quot;This work unambiguously debunks the illusion of learning from lectures,&quot; he said. &quot;It also explains why instructors and students cling to the belief that listening to lectures constitutes learning. I recommend every lecturer reads this article.&quot;</p>
<p>The work also earned accolades from Dean of Science Christopher Stubbs, Professor of Physics and of Astronomy, who was an early convert to this style of active learning.</p>
<p>&quot;When I first switched to teaching using active learning, some students resisted that change,&quot; he said. &quot;This research confirms that faculty should persist and encourage active learning. Active engagement in every classroom, led by our incredible science faculty, should be the hallmark of residential undergraduate education at Harvard.&quot;</p>
<p>Ultimately, Deslauriers said, the study shows that it's important to ensure that both instructors and students aren't fooled into thinking that lectures -- even well-presented ones -- are the best learning option.</p>
<p>&quot;A great lecture can get students to feel like they are learning a lot,&quot; he said. &quot;Students might give fabulous evaluations to an amazing lecturer based on this feeling of learning, even though their actual learning isn't optimal. This could help to explain why study after study shows that student evaluations seem to be completely uncorrelated with actual learning.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Despite active learning being recognized as a superior method of instruction in the classroom, a major recent survey found that most college STEM instructors still choose traditional teaching methods. This article addresses the long-standing question of why students and faculty remain resistant to active learning. Comparing passive lectures with active learning using a randomized experimental approach and identical course materials, we find that students in the active classroom learn more, but they feel like they learn less. We show that this negative correlation is caused in part by the increased cognitive effort required during active learning. Faculty who adopt active learning are encouraged to intervene and address this misperception, and we describe a successful example of such an intervention.</p>
<p>We compared students’ self-reported perception of learning with their actual learning under controlled conditions in large-enrollment introductory college physics courses taught using 1) active instruction (following best practices in the discipline) and 2) passive instruction (lectures by experienced and highly rated instructors). Both groups received identical class content and handouts, students were randomly assigned, and the instructor made no effort to persuade students of the benefit of either method. Students in active classrooms learned more (as would be expected based on prior research), but their perception of learning, while positive, was lower than that of their peers in passive environments. This suggests that attempts to evaluate instruction based on students’ perceptions of learning could inadvertently promote inferior (passive) pedagogical methods. For instance, a superstar lecturer could create such a positive feeling of learning that students would choose those lectures over active learning. Most importantly, these results suggest that when students experience the increased cognitive effort associated with active learning, they initially take that effort to signify poorer learning. That disconnect may have a detrimental effect on students’ motivation, engagement, and ability to self-regulate their own learning. Although students can, on their own, discover the increased value of being actively engaged during a semester-long course, their learning may be impaired during the initial part of the course. We discuss strategies that instructors can use, early in the semester, to improve students’ response to being actively engaged in the classroom.</p>

<li>we compared the amounts of learning achieved using two different instructional approaches under controlled conditions. We measured the learning of a specific set of topics and objectives when taught by 3 hours of traditional lecture given by an experienced highly rated instructor and 3 hours of instruction given by a trained but inexperienced instructor using instruction based on research in cognitive psychology and physics education. The comparison was made between two large sections (N = 267 and N = 271) of an introductory undergraduate physics course. We found increased student attendance, higher engagement, and more than twice the learning in the section taught using research-based instruction.</li>

<p>It is not the intention of this paper to review the Hawthorne effect and its history, but we comment on it only because this is such a frequent question raised about this work. It is not plausible that it resulted in a significant impact on the results reported here. As discussed extensively in (S1-S3), analyses of the methodology and data used in the original Hawthorne plant studies reveal both serious flaws in the methodology, and an absence of statistically significant data supporting the existence of the claimed effect. Thus, the failure to replicate such an effect in an educational setting, as reported in (S4), is not surprising.</p>

<p><em>respiration modulates olfactory memory consolidation in humans</em><br />

<p>&quot;Our study shows that we remember smells better if we breathe through the nose when the memory is being consolidated -- the process that takes place between learning and memory retrieval,&quot; says Artin Arshamian, researcher at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet. &quot;This is the first time someone has demonstrated this.&quot;</p>
<p>One reason why this phenomenon has not previously been available for study is that the most common laboratory animals -- rats and mice -- cannot breathe naturally through their mouths.</p>
<p>For the study, the researchers had participants learn twelve different smells on two separate occasions. They were then asked to either breathe through their noses or mouths for one hour. When the time was up, the participants were presented with the old as well as a new set of twelve smells, and asked to say if each one was from the learning session or new.</p>
<p>The results showed that when the participants breathed through their noses between the time of learning and recognition, they remembered the smells better.</p>
<p>New method facilitates measuring activity in the brain</p>
<p>&quot;The next step is to measure what actually happens in the brain during breathing and how this is linked to memory,&quot; says Dr Arshamian. &quot;This was previously a practical impossibility as electrodes had to be inserted directly into the brain. We've managed to get round this problem and now we're developing, with my colleague Johan Lundström, a new means of measuring activity in the olfactory bulb and brain without having to insert electrodes.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier research has shown that the receptors in the olfactory bulb detect not only smells but also variations in the airflow itself. In the different phases of inhalation and exhalation, different parts of the brain are activated. But how the synchronisation of breathing and brain activity happens and how it affects the brain and therefore our behaviour is unknown. Traditional medicine has often, however, stressed the importance of breathing.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea that breathing affects our behaviour is actually not new,&quot; says Dr Arshamian. &quot;In fact, the knowledge has been around for thousands of years in such areas as meditation. But no one has managed to prove scientifically what actually goes on in the brain. We now have tools that can reveal new clinical knowledge.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> In mammals respiratory-locked hippocampal rhythms are implicated in the scaffolding and transfer of information between sensory and memory networks. These oscillations are entrained by nasal respiration and driven by the olfactory bulb. They then travel to the piriform cortex where they propagate further downstream to the hippocampus and modulate neural processes critical for memory formation. In humans, bypassing nasal airflow through mouth-breathing abolishes these rhythms and impacts encoding as well as recognition processes thereby reducing memory performance. It has been hypothesized that similar behavior should be observed for the consolidation process, the stage between encoding and recognition, were memory is reactivated and strengthened. However, direct evidence for such an effect is lacking in human and nonhuman animals. Here we tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of respiration on consolidation of episodic odor memory. In two separate sessions, female and male participants encoded odors followed by a 1 h awake resting consolidation phase where they either breathed solely through their nose or mouth. Immediately after the consolidation phase, memory for odors was tested. Recognition memory significantly increased during nasal respiration compared with mouth respiration during consolidation. These results provide the first evidence that respiration directly impacts consolidation of episodic events, and lends further support to the notion that core cognitive functions are modulated by the respiratory cycle.</p>
<p>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Memories pass through three main stages in their development: encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Growing evidence from animal and human studies suggests that respiration plays an important role in the behavioral and neural mechanisms associated with encoding and recognition. Specifically nasal, but not mouth, respiration entrains neural oscillations that enhance encoding and recognition processes. We demonstrate that respiration also affects the consolidation stage. Breathing through the nose compared with the mouth during consolidation enhances recognition memory. This demonstrates, first, that nasal respiration is important during the critical period were memories are reactivated and strengthened. Second, it suggests that the neural mechanisms responsible may emerge from nasal respiration.</p>

<li>Our review of the learning-styles literature led us to define a particular type of evidence that we see as a minimum precondition for validating the use of a learning-style assessment in an instructional setting. As described earlier, we have been unable to find any evidence that clearly meets this standard. Moreover, several studies that used the appropriate type of research design found results that contradict the most widely held version of the learning-styles hypothesis, namely, what we have referred to as the meshing hypothesis (Constantinidou &amp; Baker, 2002; Massa &amp; Mayer, 2006). The contrast between the enormous popularity of the learning-styles approach within education and the lack of credible evidence for its utility is, in our opinion, striking and disturbing. If classification of students' learning styles has practical utility, it remains to be demonstrated.</li>

<li>Thus, the integration of multiple modalities can be beneficial for learning and this practice is conflated with the learning styles neuromyth. In other words, this particular neuromyth presents a challenge to the education field because it seems to be supporting effective instructional practice, but for the wrong reasons. To dispel this particular myth might inadvertently discourage diversity in instructional approaches if it is not paired with explicit discussion of the distinctions between learning styles theory and multimodal instruction.</li>
<li>Another limitation of the true/false paradigm is that we cannot discern participants' certainty of their answers because we did not include an “I don't know” answer choice.</li>
<li>Neuromyths are misconceptions about brain research and its application to education and learning. Previous research has shown that these myths may be quite pervasive among educators, but less is known about how these rates compare to the general public or to individuals who have more exposure to neuroscience. This study is the first to use a large sample from the United States to compare the prevalence and predictors of neuromyths among educators, the general public, and individuals with high neuroscience exposure. Neuromyth survey responses and demographics were gathered via an online survey hosted at TestMyBrain.org. We compared performance among the three groups of interest: educators (<em>N</em> = 598), high neuroscience exposure (<em>N</em> = 234), and the general public (<em>N</em> = 3,045) and analyzed predictors of individual differences in neuromyths performance. In an exploratory factor analysis, we found that a core group of 7 “classic” neuromyths factored together (items related to learning styles, dyslexia, the Mozart effect, the impact of sugar on attention, right-brain/left-brain learners, and using 10% of the brain). The general public endorsed the greatest number of neuromyths (<em>M</em> = 68%), with significantly fewer endorsed by educators (<em>M</em> = 56%), and still fewer endorsed by the high neuroscience exposure group (<em>M</em> = 46%). The two most commonly endorsed neuromyths across all groups were related to learning styles and dyslexia. More accurate performance on neuromyths was predicted by age (being younger), education (having a graduate degree), exposure to neuroscience courses, and exposure to peer-reviewed science. These findings suggest that training in education and neuroscience can help reduce but does not eliminate belief in neuromyths. We discuss the possible underlying roots of the most prevalent neuromyths and implications for classroom practice. These empirical results can be useful for developing comprehensive training modules for educators that target general misconceptions about the brain and learning.</li>

<p><em>when intuitive conceptions overshadow pedagogical content knowledge: teachers’ conceptions of students’ arithmetic word problem solving strategies</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Intuitive conceptions in mathematics guide the interpretation of mathematical concepts. We investigated if they bias teachers’ conceptions of student arithmetic word problem solving strategies, which should be part of their pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). In individual interviews, teachers and non-teaching adults were asked to describe students’ strategies in situational contexts within or outside the scope of the intuitive conception. The results revealed that teachers relied on their PCK and identified student strategies; however, in the presence of the intuitive conception, their PCK was overshadowed and they ceased to differ significantly from non-teachers. This brings the attention to certain biases that can have a strong impact on teachers’ efficient use of PCK.</li>

<p><em>maybe they’re born with it, or maybe it’s experience: toward a deeper understanding of the learning style myth</em><br />

<p>In two online experiments with 668 participants, more than 90 percent of them believed people learn better if they are taught in their predominant learning style, whether that is visual, auditory or tactile. But those who believed in learning styles split evenly into an &quot;essentialist&quot; group, with more strongly held beliefs, and a &quot;non-essentialist&quot; group, with more flexible beliefs about learning styles, said lead researcher Shaylene Nancekivell, PhD, a visiting scholar at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>&quot;We found that some people are more likely to believe that students inherit their learning style from their parents and that learning styles affect brain function,&quot; she said. &quot;We also found that educators who work with younger children are more likely to hold this essentialist view. Many parents and educators may be wasting time and money on products, services and teaching methods that are geared toward learning styles.&quot;</p>
<p>In their responses to survey questions, the essentialist group members were more likely to state that learning styles are heritable, instantiated in the brain, don't change with age, mark distinct kinds of people, and predict both academic and career success. The non-essentialist group held looser beliefs about learning styles, viewing them as malleable, overlapping and more determined by environmental factors. The research was published online in the Journal of Educational Psychology.</p>
<p>Psychological essentialism is the belief that certain categories of people have a true nature that is biologically based and highly predictive of many factors in their lives. People with essentialist opinions about learning styles may be more resistant to changing their strongly held views even when they learn that numerous studies have debunked the concept of learning styles, Nancekivell said.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that the learning styles model can undermine education in many ways. Educators spend time and money tailoring lessons to certain learning styles for different students even though all students would benefit from learning through various methods. Students study in ways that match their perceived learning style even though it won't help them succeed. Some teacher certification programs incorporate learning styles into their courses, which perpetuates the myth for the next generation of teachers. Academic support centers and a plethora of products also are focused on learning styles, despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting them.</p>
<p>The first experiment included participants from the general U.S. workforce, including educators. The second experiment was weighted so that at least half of the participants were educators to provide a better understanding of their views. The small percentage of participants who didn't believe in learning styles weren't included in the analysis because the study was examining differing beliefs about learning styles. Demographic factors such as race, gender, parental status and income level didn't affect people's views on learning styles in the study, but educators of young children were more likely to have essentialist beliefs.</p>
<p>&quot;My biggest concern is that time is being spent teaching young children maladaptive strategies for learning,&quot; Nancekivell said. &quot;It is important that children from a very young age are taught with the best practices so they will succeed.&quot;</p>
<p>Previous surveys in the United States and other industrialized countries across the world have shown that 80% to 95% of people believe in learning styles. It's difficult to say how that myth became so widespread, Nancekivell said.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems likely that the appeal of the learning styles myth rests in its fit with the way people like to think about behavior,&quot; she said. &quot;People prefer brain-based accounts of behavior, and they like to categorize people into types. Learning styles allow people to do both of those things.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Decades of research suggest that learning styles, or the belief that people learn better when they receive instruction in their dominant way of learning, may be one of the most pervasive myths about cognition. Nonetheless, little is known about what it means to believe in learning styles. The present investigation uses one theoretical framework—psychological essentialism—to explore the content and consistency of people’s learning style beliefs. Psychological essentialism is a belief that certain categories (such as dogs, girls, or visual learners) have an underlying reality or true nature that is biologically based and highly predictive of many other features (Gelman, 2003). We tested the prevalence of erroneous essentialist beliefs regarding learning styles in both educators and noneducators, including that learning styles are innate, unchanging, discrete, and wired into the brain. In each of two experiments, we identified two groups of learning style believers, with one group holding an essentialist interpretation of learning styles, and the other group holding a nonessentialist interpretation of learning styles. No differences were found between educators’ and noneducators’ beliefs. In fact, only one factor was found to be a significant predictor of learning style beliefs for educators: the age of the population with whom they work. Specifically, those who worked with younger children were more likely to interpret learning styles in an essentialist way. Together the findings demonstrate that learning style beliefs are far more complex and variable than previously recognized.</p>

<p><em>n-back versus complex span working memory training</em><br />
kara j. blacker et al. 2017<br />

<li>Working memory (WM) is the ability to maintain and manipulate task-relevant information in the absence of sensory input. While its improvement through training is of great interest, the degree to which WM training transfers to untrained WM tasks (near transfer) and other untrained cognitive skills (far transfer) remains debated and the mechanism(s) underlying transfer are unclear. Here we hypothesized that a critical feature of dual n-back training is its reliance on maintaining relational information in WM. In experiment 1, using an individual differences approach, we found evidence that performance on an n-back task was predicted by performance on a measure of relational WM (i.e., WM for vertical spatial relationships independent of absolute spatial locations), whereas the same was not true for a complex span WM task. In experiment 2, we tested the idea that reliance on relational WM is critical to produce transfer from n-back but not complex span task training. Participants completed adaptive training on either a dual n-back task, a symmetry span task, or on a non-WM active control task. We found evidence of near transfer for the dual n-back group; however, far transfer to a measure of fluid intelligence did not emerge. Recording EEG during a separate WM transfer task, we examined group-specific, training-related changes in alpha power, which are proposed to be sensitive to WM demands and top-down modulation of WM. Results indicated that the dual n-back group showed significantly greater frontal alpha power after training compared to before training, more so than both other groups. However, we found no evidence of improvement on measures of relational WM for the dual n-back group, suggesting that near transfer may not be dependent on relational WM. These results suggest that dual n-back and complex span task training may differ in their effectiveness to elicit near transfer as well as in the underlying neural changes they facilitate.</li>

<li>Working memory is a construct of primary relevance to many areas of psychology. Two types of tasks have been used to measure working memory, primarily in different research areas: Complex span tasks are commonly used in behavioral studies in the cognitive and individual-differences literature, whereas <em>n</em>-back tasks have been used more frequently in cognitive neuroscience studies investigating the neural underpinnings of working memory. Despite both categories of tasks being labeled as “working memory” measures, previous empirical studies have provided mixed evidence regarding the shared amount of overlapping processes between complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks. The present meta-analysis showed that the complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks are weakly correlated, although significant heterogeneity across studies was observed. A follow-up analysis of unpublished data indicated that the sample composition affects the relationship between the complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks, following the law of diminishing returns. Finally, a separate meta-analysis indicated that the simple span and <em>n</em>-back tasks are correlated to the same extent as are the complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks. The present findings indicate that the complex span and <em>n</em>-back tasks cannot be used interchangeably as working memory measures in research applications.</li>

<li>Cerebellar granule cells, which constitute half the brain's neurons, supply Purkinje cells with contextual information necessary for motor learning, but how they encode this information is unknown. Here we show, using two-photon microscopy to track neural activity over multiple days of cerebellum-dependent eyeblink conditioning in mice, that granule cell populations acquire a dense representation of the anticipatory eyelid movement. Initially, granule cells responded to neutral visual and somatosensory stimuli as well as periorbital airpuffs used for training. As learning progressed, two-thirds of monitored granule cells acquired a conditional response whose timing matched or preceded the learned eyelid movements. Granule cell activity covaried trial by trial to form a redundant code. Many granule cells were also active during movements of nearby body structures. Thus, a predictive signal about the upcoming movement is widely available at the input stage of the cerebellar cortex, as required by forward models of cerebellar control.</li>

<p><em>the eighty five percent rule for optimal learning</em><br />
robert c. wilson et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12552-4">doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12552-4</a></p>

<li>
<p>when failure occurs 15% of the time. Put another way, it's when the right answer is given 85% of the time.</p>
<p>&quot;These ideas that were out there in the education field - that there is this 'zone of proximal difficulty,' in which you ought to be maximizing your learning - we've put that on a mathematical footing,&quot; said UArizona assistant professor of psychology and cognitive science Robert Wilson, lead author of the study, titled &quot;The Eighty Five Percent Rule for Optimal Learning.&quot;</p>
<p>Wilson and his collaborators at Brown University, the University of California, Los Angeles and Princeton came up with the so-called &quot;85% Rule&quot; after conducting a series of machine-learning experiments in which they taught computers simple tasks, such as classifying different patterns into one of two categories or classifying photographs of handwritten digits as odd versus even numbers, or low versus high numbers.</p>
<p>The computers learned fastest in situations in which the difficulty was such that they responded with 85% accuracy.</p>
<p>&quot;If you have an error rate of 15% or accuracy of 85%, you are always maximizing your rate of learning in these two-choice tasks,&quot; Wilson said.</p>
<p>When researchers looked at previous studies of animal learning, they found that the 85% Rule held true in those instances as well, Wilson said.</p>
<p>When we think about how humans learn, the 85% Rule would mostly likely apply to perceptual learning, in which we gradually learn through experience and examples, Wilson said. Imagine, for instance, a radiologist learning to tell the difference between images of tumors and non-tumors.</p>
<p>&quot;You get better at figuring out there's a tumor in an image over time, and you need experience and you need examples to get better,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;I can imagine giving easy examples and giving difficult examples and giving intermediate examples. If I give really easy examples, you get 100% right all the time and there's nothing left to learn. If I give really hard examples, you'll be 50% correct and still not learning anything new, whereas if I give you something in between, you can be at this sweet spot where you are getting the most information from each particular example.&quot;</p>
<p>Since Wilson and his collaborators were looking only at simple tasks in which there was a clear correct and incorrect answer, Wilson won't go so far as to say that students should aim for a B average in school. However, he does think there might be some lessons for education that are worth further exploration.</p>
<p>&quot;If you are taking classes that are too easy and acing them all the time, then you probably aren't getting as much out of a class as someone who's struggling but managing to keep up,&quot; he said. &quot;The hope is we can expand this work and start to talk about more complicated forms of learning.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Researchers and educators have long wrestled with the question of how best to teach their clients be they humans, non-human animals or machines. Here, we examine the role of a single variable, the difficulty of training, on the rate of learning. In many situations we find that there is a sweet spot in which training is neither too easy nor too hard, and where learning progresses most quickly. We derive conditions for this sweet spot for a broad class of learning algorithms in the context of binary classification tasks. For all of these stochastic gradient-descent based learning algorithms, we find that the optimal error rate for training is around 15.87% or, conversely, that the optimal training accuracy is about 85%. We demonstrate the efficacy of this ‘Eighty Five Percent Rule’ for artificial neural networks used in AI and biologically plausible neural networks thought to describe animal learning.</p>

<p><em>montessori preschool elevates and equalizes child outcomes: a longitudinal study</em><br />

<li>Quality preschool programs that develop the whole child through age-appropriate socioemotional and cognitive skill-building hold promise for significantly improving child outcomes. However, preschool programs tend to either be teacher-led and didactic, or else to lack academic content. One preschool model that involves both child-directed, freely chosen activity and academic content is Montessori. Here we report a longitudinal study that took advantage of randomized lottery-based admission to two public Montessori magnet schools in a high-poverty American city. The final sample included 141 children, 70 in Montessori and 71 in other schools, most of whom were tested 4 times over 3 years, from the first semester to the end of preschool (ages 3–6), on a variety of cognitive and socio-emotional measures. Montessori preschool elevated children’s outcomes in several ways. Although not different at the first test point, over time the Montessori children fared better on measures of academic achievement, social understanding, and mastery orientation, and they also reported relatively more liking of scholastic tasks. They also scored higher on executive function when they were 4. In addition to elevating overall performance on these measures, Montessori preschool also equalized outcomes among subgroups that typically have unequal outcomes. First, the difference in academic achievement between lower income Montessori and higher income conventionally schooled children was smaller at each time point, and was not (statistically speaking) significantly different at the end of the study. Second, defying the typical finding that executive function predicts academic achievement, in Montessori classrooms children with lower executive function scored as well on academic achievement as those with higher executive function. This suggests that Montessori preschool has potential to elevate and equalize important outcomes, and a larger study of public Montessori preschools is warranted.</li>

<p><em>resources, learning, and policy: the relative effects of social and financial capital on student learning in schools</em><br />

<p>Social capital is the name scientists give to the network of relationships between school officials, teachers, parents and the community that builds trust and norms promoting academic achievement.<br />
The study found that social capital had a three- to five-times larger effect than financial capital on reading and math scores in Michigan schools.<br />
“When we talk about why some schools perform better than others, differences in the amount of money they have to spend is often assumed to be an explanation,” said Roger Goddard, co-author of the study and Novice G. Fawcett Chair and professor of educational administration at The Ohio State University.<br />
“We found that money is certainly important. But this study also shows that social capital deserves a larger role in our thinking about cost-effective ways to support students, especially the most vulnerable.”<br />
Goddard conducted the research with Serena Salloum of Ball State University and Dan Berebitsky of Southern Methodist University. The study appears online in the <em>Journal of Education for Students Placed at Risk</em> and will be published in a future print edition.<br />
The study involved 5,003 students and their teachers in 78 randomly selected public elementary schools in Michigan. The sample is representative of the demographics of all elementary schools in the state.<br />
Teachers completed a questionnaire that measured levels of social capital in their schools. They rated how much they agreed with statements like “Parent involvement supports learning here,” “Teachers in this school trust their students” and “Community involvement facilitates learning here.”<br />
State data on instructional expenditures per pupil was used to measure financial capital at each school.<br />
Finally, the researchers used student performance on state-mandated fourth-grade reading and mathematics tests to measure student learning.<br />
Results showed that on average schools that spent more money did have better test scores than those that spent less. But the effect of social capital was three times larger than financial capital on math scores and five times larger on reading scores.<br />
“Social capital was not only more important to learning than instructional expenditures, but also more important than the schools’ poverty, ethnic makeup or prior achievement,” Goddard said.<br />
While social capital tended to go down in schools as poverty levels increased, it wasn’t a major decrease.<br />
“We could see from our data that more than half of the social capital that schools have access to has nothing to do with the level of poverty in the communities they serve,” he said.<br />
“Our results really speak to the importance and the practicality of building social capital in high-poverty neighborhoods where they need it the most.”<br />
The study also found that the money spent on student learning was not associated with levels of social capital in schools. That means schools can’t “buy” social capital just by spending more money. Social relationships require a different kind of investment, Goddard said.<br />
The study can’t answer how to cultivate social capital in schools. But Goddard has some ideas.<br />
One is for schools to do more to help teachers work together.<br />
“Research shows that the more teachers collaborate, the more they work together on instructional improvement, the higher the test scores of their students. That’s because collaborative work builds social capital that provides students with access to valuable support,” he said.<br />
Building connections to the community is important, too. School-based mentoring programs that connect children to adults in the community is one idea.<br />
“Sustained interactions over time focused on children’s learning and effective teaching practice are the best way for people to build trust and build networks that are at the heart of social capital,” Goddard said.<br />
“We need intentional effort by schools to build social capital. We can’t leave it to chance.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> In this paper, we note the contrasting positions occupied by social and financial capital in state and federal education policy and compare their relative impacts on student learning. To make such a comparison, we analyzed data from a representative sample of Michigan’s elementary schools using multilevel structural equation modeling to examine the relationships among social capital, instructional expenditures, and student achievement. We found that the level of social capital characterizing schools was not a function of instructional expenditures. We also found that both social and financial capital had a positive and significant relationship with reading and mathematics student achievement. However, the effect of social capital was three and five times larger than that of financial capital on mathematics and reading, respectively. We discuss the implications of these findings for education policy and programs that might improve student learning by strengthening social relationships.</p>

<li>Dendritic messenger RNA (mRNA) localization and subsequent local translation in dendrites critically contributes to synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Little is known, however, about the contribution of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to these processes in vivo.<br />
Results<br />
To delineate the role of the double-stranded RBP Staufen2 (Stau2), we generate a transgenic rat model, in which Stau2 expression is conditionally silenced by Cre-inducible expression of a microRNA (miRNA) targeting Stau2 mRNA in adult forebrain neurons. Known physiological mRNA targets for Stau2, such as <em>RhoA</em>, <em>Complexin 1</em>, and <em>Rgs4</em> mRNAs, are found to be dysregulated in brains of Stau2-deficient rats. In vivo electrophysiological recordings reveal synaptic strengthening upon stimulation, showing a shift in the frequency-response function of hippocampal synaptic plasticity to favor long-term potentiation and impair long-term depression in Stau2-deficient rats. These observations are accompanied by deficits in hippocampal spatial working memory, spatial novelty detection, and in tasks investigating associative learning and memory.<br />
Conclusions<br />
Together, these experiments reveal a critical contribution of Stau2 to various forms of synaptic plasticity including spatial working memory and cognitive management of new environmental information. These findings might contribute to the development of treatments for conditions associated with learning and memory deficits.</li>

<ul>
<li>Adolescence is associated with enhanced striatal activity in response to rewards. This has been linked to increased risk-taking behavior and negative health outcomes. However, striatal activity is also important for learning, yet it is unknown whether heightened striatal responses in adolescence also benefit cognitive learning performance. In this longitudinal fMRI study (736 scans spanning 5 years in participants ages 8–29), we investigate whether adolescents show enhanced striatal activity during feedback learning, and whether this enhanced activity is associated with better learning performance. Here we report that neural activity indicating sensitivity to informative value of feedback peaks in late adolescence and occurs in dorsal caudate, ventral caudate, and nucleus accumbens. Increased activity in dorsal and ventral caudate predicts better current and future learning performance. This suggests that enhanced striatal activity in adolescents is adaptive for learning and may point to adolescence as a unique life phase for increased feedback-learning performance.</li>

•Arc protein exhibits similar biochemical properties as retroviral Gag proteins<br />
•Endogenous Arc protein is released from neurons in extracellular vesicles (EVs)<br />
•Arc EVs and capsids can mediate intercellular transfer of <em>Arc</em> mRNA in neurons</p>
<p>The neuronal gene <em>Arc</em> is essential for long-lasting information storage in the mammalian brain, mediates various forms of synaptic plasticity, and has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. However, little is known about Arc’s molecular function and evolutionary origins. Here, we show that Arc self-assembles into virus-like capsids that encapsulate RNA. Endogenous Arc protein is released from neurons in extracellular vesicles that mediate the transfer of <em>Arc</em> mRNA into new target cells, where it can undergo activity-dependent translation. Purified Arc capsids are endocytosed and are able to transfer <em>Arc</em> mRNA into the cytoplasm of neurons. These results show that Arc exhibits similar molecular properties to retroviral Gag proteins. Evolutionary analysis indicates that Arc is derived from a vertebrate lineage of Ty3/<em>gypsy</em> retrotransposons, which are also ancestors to retroviruses. These findings suggest that Gag retroelements have been repurposed during evolution to mediate intercellular communication in the nervous system.</p>

<p><em>advancing the science of collaborative problem solving</em><br />
arthur c. graesser et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1177/1529100618808244">doi.org/10.1177/1529100618808244</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an interdisciplinary team of researchers identifies the essential cognitive and social components of collaborative problem solving (CPS) and shows how integrating existing knowledge from a variety of fields can lead to new ways of assessing and training these abilities.</p>
<p>&quot;CPS is an essential skill in the workforce and the community because many of the problems faced in the modern world require teams to integrate group achievements with team members' idiosyncratic knowledge,&quot; the authors of the report say.</p>
<p>As societies and technologies become increasingly complex, they generate increasingly complex problems. Devising efficient, effective, and innovative solutions to these complex problems requires CPS skills that most students lack. According to a 2015 assessment of more than 500,000 15-year-old students conducted by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, only 8% of students around the world showed strong CPS skills.</p>
<p>&quot;The experiences of students in and out of the classroom are not preparing them for these skills that are needed as adults,&quot; Graesser and colleagues write.</p>
<p>This unique set of cognitive and social skills include:</p>
<p>Shared understanding: Group members share common goals when solving a new problem.<br />
Accountability: The contributions that each member makes are visible to the rest of the group.<br />
Differentiated roles: Group members draw on their specific expertise to complete different tasks.<br />
Interdependency: Group members depend on the contributions of others to solve the problem.<br />
One reason for the lack of CPS training is a deficit in evidence-based standards and curricula. Secondary school curricula typically focus on educating task- and discipline-specific knowledge, placing little emphasis on educating students' ability to communicate and collaborate effectively.</p>
<p>&quot;Students rarely receive meaningful instruction, modeling, and feedback on collaboration,&quot; the researchers note.</p>
<p>When students do receive training relevant to CPS, it is often because they participate in extracurricular activities such as band, sports, student newspapers, and volunteer activities. Even then, the collaborative competencies are not directly relevant to problem solving. The authors argue that it is time to make CPS activities a core part of the curriculum.</p>
<p>Although considerable psychological, educational, and management research has examined factors that contribute to effective learning, teamwork, and decision making, research that directly examines how to improve collaborative problem solving is scarce.</p>
<p>According to the authors, &quot;we are nearly at ground zero in identifying pedagogical approaches to improving CPS skills.&quot;</p>
<p>Developing and implementing effective CPS training stands to have significant societal impacts across a wide range of domains, including business, science, education, technology, environment, and public health. In a project funded by the National Science Foundation, for example, Fiore and other research team members are training students to collaborate across a range of disciplines -- including environmental science, ecology, biology, law, and policy -- to identify ways to address social, business, and agricultural effects of rising sea levels in Virginia's Eastern Shore.</p>
<p>&quot;It's exciting to engage in real world testing of methods developed in laboratory studies on teamwork, to see how feedback on collaboration, and reflection on that feedback to improve teamwork strategies, can improve students' problem solving,&quot; Fiore explains.</p>
<p>Identifying the necessary components of this kind of training and determining how to translate those components across a variety of real-world settings will, itself, require interdisciplinary cooperation among researchers, educators, and policymakers.</p>
<p>In the commentary, Gauvain emphasizes that achieving a comprehensive understanding of CPS requires taking a developmental perspective and she notes that psychological scientists will be essential in this endeavor. Graesser and colleagues agree:</p>
<p>&quot;When psychological scientists collaborate with educational researchers, computer scientists, psychometricians, and educational experts, we hope to move forward in addressing this global deficit in CPS,&quot; they conclude.</p>
</li>

<p><em>abstract</em> Collaborative problem solving (CPS) has been receiving increasing international attention because much of the complex work in the modern world is performed by teams. However, systematic education and training on CPS is lacking for those entering and participating in the workforce. In 2015, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a global test of educational progress, documented the low levels of proficiency in CPS. This result not only underscores a significant societal need but also presents an important opportunity for psychological scientists to develop, adopt, and implement theory and empirical research on CPS and to work with educators and policy experts to improve training in CPS. This article offers some directions for psychological science to participate in the growing attention to CPS throughout the world. First, it identifies the existing theoretical frameworks and empirical research that focus on CPS. Second, it provides examples of how recent technologies can automate analyses of CPS processes and assessments so that substantially larger data sets can be analyzed and so students can receive immediate feedback on their CPS performance. Third, it identifies some challenges, debates, and uncertainties in creating an infrastructure for research, education, and training in CPS. CPS education and assessment are expected to improve when supported by larger data sets and theoretical frameworks that are informed by psychological science. This will require interdisciplinary efforts that include expertise in psychological science, education, assessment, intelligent digital technologies, and policy.</p>

<p><em>modulating cellular cytotoxicity and phototoxicity of fluorescent organic salts through counterion pairing</em><br />

<a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51593-z">doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51593-z</a><br />
interesting story of how this paper came to be</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;This work has the potential to transform fluorescent probes for broad societal impact through applications ranging from biomedicine to photocatalysis -- the acceleration of chemical reactions with light,&quot; he said. &quot;Our solar research inspired this cancer project, and in turn, focusing on cancer cells has advanced our solar cell research; it's been an amazing feedback loop.&quot;</p>
<p>Prior to the Lunts' combined effort, fluorescent dyes used for therapeutics and diagnostics, aka &quot;theranostics,&quot; had shortcomings, such as low brightness, high toxicity to cells, poor tissue penetration and unwanted side effects.</p>
<p>By optoelectronically tuning organic salt nanoparticles used as theranostics, the Lunts were able to control them in a range of cancer studies. Coaxing the nanoparticles into the nontoxic zone resulted in enhanced imaging, while pushing them into the phototoxic -- or light-activated -- range produced effective on-site tumor treatment.</p>
<p>The key was learning to control the electronics of their photoactive molecules independently from their optical properties and then making the leap to apply this understanding in a new way to a seemingly unrelated field.</p>
<p>Richard had recently discovered the ability to electronically tune these salts from his work in converting photovoltaics into solar glass. Sophia had long studied metabolic pathways unique to cancer cells. It was when the Lunts were discussing solar glass during a walk that they made the connection: Molecules active in the solar cells might also be used to more effectively target and kill cancer cells.</p>
<p>A journey of 1,000 miles</p>
<p>Their walks had rather unscientific beginnings. Shortly after the Lunts met at Princeton University, Richard moved to another university. To maintain their long-distance relationship, they scheduled daily phone calls. Upon their arrival at MSU, individual academic career demands replaced geographic distance as a challenge to their busy lives.</p>
<p>To connect daily, they take CEO-style walks together every evening. The two-mile saunters take place rain or shine, and they often engage in scientific discussions. The three keys to their walks are intentional curiosity, perseverance and the merging of different fields and perspectives, Sophia said.</p>
<p>&quot;We talk science, strategic plans for our careers and our various grants,&quot; she said. &quot;We ping ideas off each other. Our continual conversations brainstorming ideas on a particular topic or challenge often lead to those exciting 'aha' moments.&quot;</p>
<p>Their walks have helped them push through many challenges.</p>
<p>&quot;Our first experiments did not turn out as expected; I'm surprised that we didn't give up given how crazy the idea seemed at first,&quot; Richard said. &quot;Figuring out how to do this research took many walks.&quot;</p>
<p>Obviously, the results were worth the hike. Today, Richard designs the molecules; Babak Borhan, MSU chemist, synthesizes and improves them; and Sophia tests their photoactive inventions in cancer cell lines and mouse models.</p>
<p>Future research will work to improve the theranostics' effectiveness, decrease toxicity and reduce side effects. The Lunts have applied for a patent for their work, and they're looking forward to eventually pushing their photoactive molecule findings through clinical trials.</p>
<p>&quot;Though that will take many more walks,&quot; Richard said with a smile.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Light-activated theranostics offer promising opportunities for disease diagnosis, image-guided surgery, and site-specific personalized therapy. However, current fluorescent dyes are limited by low brightness, high cytotoxicity, poor tissue penetration, and unwanted side effects. To overcome these limitations, we demonstrate a platform for optoelectronic tuning, which allows independent control of the optical properties from the electronic properties of fluorescent organic salts. This is achieved through cation-anion pairing of organic salts that can modulate the frontier molecular orbital without impacting the bandgap. Optoelectronic tuning enables decoupled control over the cytotoxicity and phototoxicity of fluorescent organic salts by selective generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species that control cell viability. We show that through counterion pairing, organic salt nanoparticles can be tuned to be either nontoxic for enhanced imaging, or phototoxic for improved photodynamic therapy.</p>

<li>In its most basic form, learning comes down to feedback. For example, if you have a headache and take a drug, you expect the drug will make your headache go away. If you’re right, you’ll take that drug the next time you have a headache. If you’re wrong, you’ll try something else. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied this aspect of learning extensively and even traced it to specific parts of the brain that process feedback and drive learning.<br />
Still, that picture of learning is incomplete, Chen said. Even in relatively uncomplicated laboratory experiments, let alone life in the real world, humans and other animals need to figure out what to learn from — essentially, what’s feedback and what’s noise. Despite that need, it’s an issue psychologists and neuroscientists have not paid as much attention to.<br />
To start to remedy that, Chen and colleagues taught mice to associate particular odors with good and bad outcomes. One odor signaled a sip of water was coming, while another signaled the mouse was about to get a puff of air to the face.<br />
Later, the researchers replaced the air puff with a mild electric shock — something that would presumably command a bit more attention. The team found that neurons in the PVT tracked that change. During the air-puff phase, two-thirds of PVT neurons responded to both odors while an additional 30 percent were activated only by the odor signaling water. In other words, during this phase the PVT responded to both good and bad outcomes, but there was greater response to good.<br />
During the electric-shock phase, however, the balance shifted. Almost all PVT neurons responded to the shock, while about three quarters of them responded to both good and bad outcomes.<br />
A similar shift happened when mice had had their fill of water. Now that water mattered less to the mice, the PVT was less responsive to water and more responsive to air puffs, meaning it became more responsive to bad outcomes and less so to good ones. Taken together, the results showed the PVT tracks what was most important in the moment — the good outcome when that outweighed the bad, and vice versa.<br />
<strong>A new place to look, and to tweak</strong><br />
The results point to several broader conclusions, Chen said. Perhaps most important, other researchers now have a place to look — the PVT — when they want to study how paying attention to different details affects how and what animals learn.<br />
Neuroscientists also now have a new way to control learning, Chen said. In additional experiments with mice genetically modified so the team could control PVT activity with light, the researchers found they could inhibit or enhance learning — for example, they could more quickly teach mice that an odor no longer reliably signaled water was coming, or that another odor had switched from signaling water to signaling a shock.<br />
Those results could point to new ways to modulate learning — in mice, for the time being — by stimulating or suppressing PVT activity as appropriate. They also point, in the long run, to ways to help treat drug addiction, Chen said, by helping addicts unlearn the association between taking a drug and the subsequent high.</li>

<p>In addition, the study shows that the beneficial effects of training in the brain and intelligence are greater when an educator implement a coaching strategy design in order to help the child understand their training process.</p>
<p>The training program has been developed by researchers from the UGR, and consists of exercises based on experimental paradigms that activates brain areas responsible for the regulation and control of attention. These are activities that are performed on the computer or tablet, and requires focusing attention and respond attentively to situations in which the dominant responses are not correct. Other exercises require keeping the instructions in memory and adapting to changing rules.</p>
<p>&quot;The results of this research suggest that it is important to educate attention from early childhood,&quot; explains the lead author of this work, the researcher at the Experimental Psychology Department of the University of Granada María Rosario Rueda Cuerva.</p>
<p>In addition, they indicate that the most effective strategies are those in which the educator helps the child to reflect on his or her learning process. &quot;Through the education of attention we can improve the intelligence of children and prepare them for formal learning in school,&quot; says the researcher.</p>

<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Interventions including social scaffolding and metacognitive strategies have been used in educational settings to promote cognition. In addition, increasing evidence shows that computerized process‐based training enhances cognitive skills. However, no prior studies have examined the effect of combining these two training strategies. The goal of this study was to test the combined effect of metacognitive scaffolding and computer‐based training of executive attention in a sample of typically developing preschoolers at the cognitive and brain levels. Compared to children in the regular training protocol and an untrained active control group, children in the metacognitive group showed larger gains on intelligence and significant increases on an electrophysiological index associated with conflict processing. Moreover, changes in the conflict‐related brain activity predicted gains in intelligence in the metacognitive scaffolding group. These results suggest that metacognitive scaffolding boosts the influence of process‐based training on cognitive efficiency and brain plasticity related to executive attention.</p>

<p><em>predictions as a window into learning: anticipatory fixation offsets carry more information about environmental statistics than reactive stimulus-responses</em><br />

<p>many factors intervene between what people actually know, and how they respond based on that knowledge. These factors are known to include the level of attention allocated to external stimuli, the interpretation of sensory information, as well as complex decision processes. All these factors impact how people respond to stimuli they see. However, these factors do not impact anticipatory movements, and the authors examined whether it is possible to determine what people know, and how they learn, by studying only anticipatory behaviors. Their findings suggest that anticipatory behavior may in certain cases be more informative about learning. These results open future developments for studying learning in populations that demonstrate non-reliable responses to external stimulus, such as young children or individuals suffering from physical or mental disorders, for whom it may be more difficult to assess the degree of attention and understanding.</p>
<p>The study</p>
<p>How is possible to know if one is learning and assimilating useful information? The novel answer suggested by the study is that it is useful to observe preparatory, unconscious eye movements, because these offer a window into the process of learning. In the experiment performed, the researchers collected data using an eye-tracker, a device that allows to measure our gaze direction. &quot;We presented volunteers with series of images that were presented on the left or right side of the screen, according to a specific, learnable pattern,&quot; Notaro explains: &quot;We observed how fast people were to look at those images, depending on whether the images were presented at an unexpected or expected location. Surprisingly, the position of the eyes before the next image was presented was biased towards the expected position of the next image. This was a very small eye movement that turned out to be highly informative. It let us infer that the brain can prepare in advance, once an information is learnt. This allows to isolate a mental state that holds before obtaining the 'usual' responses that are triggered by external stimuli (such as verbal answers or button presses).&quot;</p>
<p>Application scenarios</p>
<p>These findings open potential application scenarios, including in the areas of education and health, and particularly in relation to populations with attention or communication deficits. &quot;The presence of these anticipatory signals -- Hasson adds -- provides us with an opportunity to measure attentive capacity and learning with greater precision. These are tiny signals that very likely reflect unconscious processes. At the same time, they are highly reliable, and allow us to forecast how participants may respond to stimuli. The inter-relations of learning and prediction is a topic that arouses much interest transversely, not only in the scientific community, and it touches on areas that may be very close to our daily life. For example, there are already large investments made today in areas such as online advertisement and entertainment that aim to study people's eye movements and how those forecast behavior and memory. Identifying an anticipatory signature in eye movements can advance those areas as well.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> A core question underlying neurobiological and computational models of behavior is how individuals learn environmental statistics and use them to make predictions. Most investigations of this issue have relied on reactive paradigms, in which inferences about predictive processes are derived by modeling responses to stimuli that vary in likelihood. Here we deployed a novel anticipatory oculomotor metric to determine how input statistics impact anticipatory behavior that is decoupled from target-driven-response. We implemented transition constraints between target locations, so that the probability of a target being presented on the same side as the previous trial was 70% in one condition (pret70) and 30% in the other (pret30). Rather than focus on responses to targets, we studied subtle endogenous anticipatory fixation offsets (AFOs) measured while participants fixated the screen center, awaiting a target. These AFOs were small (&lt;0.4° from center on average), but strongly tracked global-level statistics. Speaking to learning dynamics, trial-by-trial fluctuations in AFO were well-described by a learning model, which identified a lower learning rate in pret70 than pret30, corroborating prior suggestions that pret70 is subjectively treated as more regular. Most importantly, direct comparisons with saccade latencies revealed that AFOs: (a) reflected similar temporal integration windows, (b) carried more information about the statistical context than did saccade latencies, and (c) accounted for most of the information that saccade latencies also contained about inputs statistics. Our work demonstrates how strictly predictive processes reflect learning dynamics, and presents a new direction for studying learning and prediction.</p>

<p><em>regulation of arousal via online neurofeedback improves human performance in a demanding sensory-motor task</em><br />

<p>online neurofeedback to modify an individual's arousal state to improve performance in a demanding sensory motor task, such as flying a plane or driving in suboptimal conditions. The researchers used a brain computer interface (BCI) to monitor, through electroencephalography (EEG) in real time, the arousal states of the study participants when they were engaged in a virtual reality aerial navigation task. The system generated a neurofeedback signal that helped participants to decrease their arousal in particularly difficult flight situations, which in turn improved participants' performance. The study was published today by Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole question of how you can get into the zone, whether you're a baseball hitter or a stock trader or a fighter pilot, has always been an intriguing one,&quot; says Paul Sajda, professor of biomedical engineering (BME), electrical engineering, and radiology, who led the study. &quot;Our work shows that we can use feedback generated from our own brain activity to shift our arousal state in ways that significantly improve our performance in difficult tasks -- so we can hit that home run or land on a carrier deck without crashing.&quot;</p>
<p>The 20 subjects in the study were immersed in a virtual reality scenario in which they had to navigate a simulated airplane through rectangular boundaries. Known as a boundary avoidance task, this demanding sensory-motor task model created cognitive stresses, such as making the boxes narrower every 30 seconds, that escalated arousal and quickly resulted in task failure -- missing or crashing into the boundary. But when the researchers used neurofeedback, the subjects did better, were able to fly longer while performing the difficult tasks that required high levels of visual and motor coordination.</p>
<p>There were three feedback conditions (BCI, sham, and silence) randomly assigned for every new flight attempt. In the BCI condition, subjects heard the sound of a low-rate synthetic heartbeat that was continuously modulated in loudness as a function of the level of inferred task-dependent arousal, as decoded from the EEG. The higher that level of arousal, the louder the feedback and vice versa. Participants' task performance in the BCI condition, measured as time and distance over which the subject can navigate before failure, was increased by around 20 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Simultaneous measurements of pupil dilation and heart rate variability showed that the neurofeedback indeed reduced arousal, causing the subjects to remain calm and fly beyond the point at which they would normally fail,&quot; says Josef Faller, the study's lead author and a postdoctoral research scientist in BME. &quot;Our work is the first demonstration of a BCI system that uses online neurofeedback to shift arousal state and improve task performance in accordance with the Yerkes-Dodson law.&quot;</p>
<p>The Yerkes-Dodson law is a well-established and intensively studied law in behavioral psychology about the relationship between arousal and performance. Developed in 1908, it posits an inverse-relationship between arousal and task performance, that there is a state of arousal that is optimal for behavioral performance in a given task. In this new study, the researchers showed that they could use neurofeedback in real time to move an individual's arousal from the right side of the Yerkes-Dodson curve to the left, toward a state of improved performance.</p>
<p>&quot;What's exciting about our new approach is that it is applicable to different task domains,&quot; Sajda adds. &quot;This includes clinical applications that use self-regulation as a targeted treatment, such as mental illness.&quot;</p>
<p>The researchers are now studying how neurofeedback can be used to regulate arousal and emotion for clinical conditions such as PTSD. They are also exploring how they might use online monitoring of arousal and cognitive control to inform human-agent teaming, when a robot and a human work together in a high-stress situation like a rescue. If the robot has information on the human's arousal state, it could choose its tasks in a way that reduces its teammate's arousal, pushing her/him into an ideal performance zone.</p>
<p>&quot;Good human-agent teams, like the Navy SEALS, do this already, but that is because the human-agents can read facial expressions, voice patterns, etc., of their teammates to infer arousal and stress levels,&quot; Sajda says. &quot;We envision our system being a better way to communicate not just this type of information, but much more to a robot-agent.&quot;</p>

<p>Our ability to make optimal decisions, judgments, and actions in real-world dynamic environments depends on our state of arousal. We show that we can use electroencephalography-based feedback to shift an individual’s arousal so that their task performance increases significantly. This work demonstrates a closed-loop brain–computer interface for dynamically shifting arousal to affect online task performance in accordance with the Yerkes and Dodson law. The approach is potentially applicable to different task domains and/or for clinical applications that utilize self-regulation as a targeted treatment, such as in mental illness.</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Our state of arousal can significantly affect our ability to make optimal decisions, judgments, and actions in real-world dynamic environments. The Yerkes–Dodson law, which posits an inverse-U relationship between arousal and task performance, suggests that there is a state of arousal that is optimal for behavioral performance in a given task. Here we show that we can use online neurofeedback to shift an individual’s arousal from the right side of the Yerkes–Dodson curve to the left toward a state of improved performance. Specifically, we use a brain–computer interface (BCI) that uses information in the EEG to generate a neurofeedback signal that dynamically adjusts an individual’s arousal state when they are engaged in a boundary-avoidance task (BAT). The BAT is a demanding sensory-motor task paradigm that we implement as an aerial navigation task in virtual reality and which creates cognitive conditions that escalate arousal and quickly results in task failure (e.g., missing or crashing into the boundary). We demonstrate that task performance, measured as time and distance over which the subject can navigate before failure, is significantly increased when veridical neurofeedback is provided. Simultaneous measurements of pupil dilation and heart-rate variability show that the neurofeedback indeed reduces arousal. Our work demonstrates a BCI system that uses online neurofeedback to shift arousal state and increase task performance in accordance with the Yerkes–Dodson law.</p>

<p>resting, early and often, may be just as critical to learning as practice,&quot; said Leonardo G. Cohen, M.D., Ph.D., senior investigator at NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and a senior author of the paper published in the journal Current Biology. &quot;Our ultimate hope is that the results of our experiments will help patients recover from the paralyzing effects caused by strokes and other neurological injuries by informing the strategies they use to 'relearn' lost skills.&quot;</p>
<p>The study was led by Marlene Bönstrup, M.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Cohen's lab. Like many scientists, she held the general belief that our brains needed long periods of rest, such as a good night's sleep, to strengthen the memories formed while practicing a newly learned skill. But after looking at brain waves recorded from healthy volunteers in learning and memory experiments at the NIH Clinical Center, she started to question the idea.</p>
<p>The waves were recorded from right-handed volunteers with a highly sensitive scanning technique called magnetoencephalography. The subjects sat in a chair facing a computer screen and under a long cone-shaped brain scanning cap. The experiment began when they were shown a series of numbers on a screen and asked to type the numbers as many times as possible with their left hands for 10 seconds; take a 10 second break; and then repeat this trial cycle of alternating practice and rest 35 more times. This strategy is typically used to reduce any complications that could arise from fatigue or other factors.</p>
<p>As expected, the volunteers' speed at which they correctly typed the numbers improved dramatically during the first few trials and then leveled off around the 11th cycle. When Dr. Bönstrup looked at the volunteers' brain waves she observed something interesting.</p>
<p>&quot;I noticed that participants' brain waves seemed to change much more during the rest periods than during the typing sessions,&quot; said Dr. Bönstrup. &quot;This gave me the idea to look much more closely for when learning was actually happening. Was it during practice or rest?&quot;</p>
<p>By reanalyzing the data, she and her colleagues made two key findings. First, they found that the volunteers' performance improved primarily during the short rests, and not during typing. The improvements made during the rest periods added up to the overall gains the volunteers made that day. Moreover, these gains were much greater than the ones seen after the volunteers returned the next day to try again, suggesting that the early breaks played as critical a role in learning as the practicing itself.</p>
<p>Second, by looking at the brain waves, Dr. Bönstrup found activity patterns that suggested the volunteers' brains were consolidating, or solidifying, memories during the rest periods. Specifically, they found that the changes in the size of brain waves, called beta rhythms, correlated with the improvements the volunteers made during the rests.</p>
<p>Further analysis suggested that the changes in beta oscillations primarily happened in the right hemispheres of the volunteers' brains and along neural networks connecting the frontal and parietal lobes that are known to help control the planning of movements. These changes only happened during the breaks and were the only brain wave patterns that correlated with performance.</p>
<p>&quot;Our results suggest that it may be important to optimize the timing and configuration of rest intervals when implementing rehabilitative treatments in stroke patients or when learning to play the piano in normal volunteers,&quot; said Dr. Cohen. &quot;Whether these results apply to other forms of learning and memory formation remains an open question.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> •Temporal microscale of motor-skill learning reveals strong gains during rest periods<br />
•Online motor-skill learning may rely largely on gains during short periods of rest<br />
•Frontoparietal beta oscillatory activity predicts these micro-offline gains<br />
•This rapid form of consolidation substantially contributes to early skill learning</p>
<p>The brain strengthens memories through consolidation, defined as resistance to interference (stabilization) or performance improvements between the end of a practice session and the beginning of the next (offline gains) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119011357/http://ournature.org/%7Enovembre/illich/1970_deschooling.html">1</a>. Typically, consolidation has been measured hours or days after the completion of training <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119011357/http://ournature.org/%7Enovembre/illich/">2</a>, but the same concept may apply to periods of rest that occur interspersed in a series of practice bouts within the same session. Here, we took an unprecedented close look at the within-seconds time course of early human procedural learning over alternating short periods of practice and rest that constitute a typical online training session. We found that performance did not markedly change over short periods of practice. On the other hand, performance improvements in between practice periods, when subjects were at rest, were significant and accounted for early procedural learning. These offline improvements were more prominent in early training trials when the learning curve was steep and no performance decrements during preceding practice periods were present. At the neural level, simultaneous magnetoencephalographic recordings showed an anatomically defined signature of this phenomenon. Beta-band brain oscillatory activity in a predominantly contralateral frontoparietal network predicted rest-period performance improvements. Consistent with its role in sensorimotor engagement <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1539-6053.2009.01038.x">3</a>, modulation of beta activity may reflect replay of task processes during rest periods. We report a rapid form of offline consolidation that substantially contributes to early skill learning and may extend the concept of consolidation to a time scale in the order of seconds, rather than the hours or days traditionally accepted.</p>

<p><em>dissociating task acquisition from expression during learning reveals latent knowledge</em><br />
kishore v. kuchibhotla et al. 2019<br />

<p>show a distinction between knowledge and performance, and provide insight into how environment can affect the two.</p>
<p>&quot;Most learning research focuses on how humans and other animals learn 'content' or knowledge. Here, we suggest that there are two parallel learning processes: one for content and one for context, or environment. If we can separate how these two pathways work, perhaps we can find ways to improve performance,&quot; says Kishore Kuchibhotla, an assistant professor in The Johns Hopkins University's department of psychological and brain sciences and the study's lead author.</p>
<p>While researchers have known that the presence of reinforcement, or reward, can change how animals behave, it's been unclear exactly how rewards affect learning versus performance.</p>
<p>An example of the difference between learning and performance, Kuchibhotla explains, is the difference between a student studying and knowing the answers at home, and a student demonstrating that knowledge on a test at school.</p>
<p>&quot;What we know at any given time can be different than what we show; the ability to access that knowledge in the right environment is what we're interested in,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>To investigate what animals know in hopes of better understanding learning, Kuchibhotla and the research team trained mice, rats and ferrets on a series of tasks, and measured how accurately they performed the tasks with and without rewards.</p>
<p>For the first experiment, the team trained mice to lick for water through a lick tube after hearing one tone, and to not lick after hearing a different, unrewarded tone. It takes mice two weeks to learn this in the presence of the water reward. At a time point early in learning, around days 3-5, the mice performed the task at chance levels (about 50%) when the lick tube/reward was present. When the team removed the lick tube entirely on these early days, however, the mice performed the task at more than 90% accuracy. The mice, therefore, seemed to understand the task many days before they expressed knowledge in the presence of a reward.</p>
<p>To confirm this finding with other tasks and animals, the team also had mice press a lever for water when they heard a certain tone; prompted rats to look for food in a cup if they heard a tone, but not if a light appeared before the tone; had rats press a lever for sugar water when a light was presented before a tone; had rats push lever for sugar water when they heard a certain tone, and prompted ferrets to differentiate between two different sounds for water. In all experiments, the animals performed better when rewards weren't available.</p>
<p>&quot;Rewards, it seems, help improve learning incrementally, but can mask the knowledge animals have actually attained, particularly early in learning,&quot; says Kuchibhotla. Furthermore, the finding that all animals' performance improved across the board without rewards, suggest that variability in learning rates may be due to differences in the animals' sensitivity to reward context rather than differences in intelligence.</p>
<p>The dissociation between learning and performance, the researchers suggest, may someday help us isolate the root causes of poor performance. While the study involved only rodents and ferrets, Kuchibhotla says it may be possible to someday help animals and humans alike better access content when they need it if the right mechanisms within the brain can be identified and manipulated.</p>
<p>For humans, this could help those with Alzheimer's Disease maintain lucidity for longer periods of time and improve testing environments for schoolchildren.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Performance on cognitive tasks during learning is used to measure knowledge, yet it remains controversial since such testing is susceptible to contextual factors. To what extent does performance during learning depend on the testing context, rather than underlying knowledge? We trained mice, rats and ferrets on a range of tasks to examine how testing context impacts the acquisition of knowledge versus its expression. We interleaved reinforced trials with probe trials in which we omitted reinforcement. Across tasks, each animal species performed remarkably better in probe trials during learning and inter-animal variability was strikingly reduced. Reinforcement feedback is thus critical for learning-related behavioral improvements but, paradoxically masks the expression of underlying knowledge. We capture these results with a network model in which learning occurs during reinforced trials while context modulates only the read-out parameters. Probing learning by omitting reinforcement thus uncovers latent knowledge and identifies context- not “smartness”- as the major source of individual variability.</p>

<p><em>object‐label‐order effect when learning from an inconsistent source</em><br />
timmy ma, natalia l. komarova et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1111/cogs.12737">doi.org/10.1111/cogs.12737</a></p>

<p>learn better when seeing an object before hearing its description. The study builds on past research by focusing on learning in &quot;inconsistent&quot; environments featuring different teaching styles or distracting noises.</p>
<p>&quot;Understanding how the learning process occurs, and what factors affect it, may help instructors improve methodologies of education,&quot; said Timmy Ma, a research associate at Dartmouth.</p>
<p>Learning environments can often complicate the learning process. For example, a student taking a course with both a teacher and a teaching assistant needs to adapt to the ways the different instructors teach the same subject. Even the varying ways teachers talk and behave can complicate learning.</p>
<p>For the study, researchers intentionally provided confusing information to mimic these types of inconsistencies to subjects that were tasked to learn the names of three fictional characters -- &quot;yosh,&quot; &quot;wug&quot; and &quot;niz&quot; -- using two types of learning methods.</p>
<p>The first method, &quot;object-label learning,&quot; is when a student sees an object first and then is provided with the label. This means seeing a color before being told its name. Or hearing a description of a physical force before being hearing its formal title.</p>
<p>The second learning procedure is &quot;label-object learning,&quot; the reverse order in which a student sees a label first.</p>
<p>Subjects in the study were asked to match the pictures of the characters with their made-up names. The presentation of information was intentionally misleading to see if learners have an easier time dealing with the inconsistency depending on the way the input was presented -- either object first or label first.</p>
<p>The results of the study indicate that students who see objects first and then hear the name -- object-label learners -- process inconsistent information better than learners who hear the name first and then see the object.</p>
<p>Researchers detected that learners that interact with the object before hearing the name perform &quot;frequency boosting&quot; -- the ability to process noisy, inconsistent information to identify and use the most frequent rule.</p>
<p>For example, when teachers interchangeably use &quot;soda&quot; or &quot;pop&quot; to describe the name of a carbonated beverage, the children who use frequency boosting will learn to use the term that is used most frequently.</p>
<p>A key feature of frequency boosting is that learners will also use the rule more consistently than the instructor.</p>
<p>&quot;When trying to teach a child about colors, such as blue or red, not many people think about the best way to do it. People just say this is blue and point to an object. From this research, we can say that the order of presentation actually matters and that seeing the object first creates a stronger association to the name,&quot; said Ma who conducted the research while a PhD candidate at the University of California, Irvine.</p>
<p>The research team also used mathematical modeling to confirm the observations as well as provide a theoretical explanation as to why one type of learner is different from the other.</p>
<p>&quot;This research combines experiments with a novel mathematical model to show that object-label learners deal better with inconsistencies. It's exciting to see that the math theory explains the observational data,&quot; said Ma.</p>
<p>According to the research team, understanding how people learn could have broad applications. For example, foreign language learning programs could benefit from showing images before introducing the name of an object. The results can also be applied to math, science or any other subjects where students need to make similar associations.</p>
</li>

<p><em>abstract</em> Learning in natural environments is often characterized by a degree of inconsistency from an input. These inconsistencies occur, for example, when learning from more than one source, or when the presence of environmental noise distorts incoming information; as a result, the task faced by the learner becomes ambiguous. In this study, we investigate how learners handle such situations. We focus on the setting where a learner receives and processes a sequence of utterances to master associations between objects and their labels, where the source is inconsistent by design: It uses both “correct” and “incorrect” object‐label pairings. We hypothesize that depending on the order of presentation, the result of the learning may be different. To this end, we consider two types of symbolic learning procedures: the Object‐Label (OL) and the Label‐Object (LO) process. In the OL process, the learner is first exposed to the object, and then the label. In the LO process, this order is reversed. We perform experiments with human subjects, and also construct a computational model that is based on a nonlinear stochastic reinforcement learning algorithm. It is observed experimentally that OL learners are generally better at processing inconsistent input compared to LO learners. We show that the patterns observed in the learning experiments can be reproduced in the simulations if the model includes (a) an ability to regularize the input (and also to do the opposite, i.e., undermatch) and (b) an ability to take account of implicit negative evidence (i.e., interactions among different objects/labels). The model suggests that while both types of learners utilize implicit negative evidence in a similar way, there is a difference in regularization patterns: OL learners regularize the input, whereas LO learners undermatch. As a result, OL learners are able to form a more consistent system of image‐utterance associations, despite the ambiguous learning task.</p>

<p>just–so stories indeed, by definition: “if a cognitive ability is found not only in humans but also in other animals, its development is very unlikely to depend on culture. More generally, when species that are closely genetically related to humans, such as chimpanzees, have a more human like cognitive capacity than species that are distantly related to humans, such as rats, all other things being equal, it suggests that development of the focal capacity is heavily dependent on genetic information.”</p>

<li>what is learning? how do we come to appreciate something may be true when we previously believed it was not true or even did not know of the possibility that such a thing could even occur?
<ul>
<li>because they are stuck in the logic of their current position, they can’t yet learn to change their opinion on a topic. this is the crux of the issue and also of how we learn and change and grow.</li>
<li>is this the process which becomes more difficult as we become older? not the learning itself but the removal of the baggage, the conscious logical structures we have built up through long experience is more and more consuming the energy that could have gone into the process of acceptance?</li>
<li>this is the very same issue as Socrates is held to expose in the Apology: how to help others learn what they do not already know, when they may hold power over you, power that may be abusive and inimical?</li>
<li>currently, thinking is about conscious thinking in our society, not about thinking which cannot be described or transmitted in words. is it possible to improve that kind of thinking that we cannot describe? I believe it is not only possible but imperative to do so</li>

<h2>01331</h2>
<ul>
<li>how to approach learning in a open way. be aware that everything has advantages as well as disadvantages. allow yourself to absorb the information about it, while letting your inner experience be your guide rather than what people try to convince you is right. but for this to work you will need to question and change your inner experience often and regularly.</li>
<li>absorb and synthesise information, while remaining aware of cognitive bias (e.g. familiarity bias), to extract what is useful</li>
</ul>
<h2>01231</h2>
<ul>
<li>illusory knowledge, when you read something and it triggers recognition that you have read it before, gives illusion of being able to access and use that knowledge at will at another time as needed, when actually it is habituated reuse of that knowledge which would make that possible.</li>

<li>real learning is not about understanding some perfect structure or path but about the little fragments that stick and that we use in our reconstruction, that give hints towards progress and ledges from which we leap in our perception</li>
</ul>
<h2>00831</h2>
<ul>
<li>if time is our ultimate constraint then knowledge is one of the releases from it — knowledge does not always need to be gathered by each person on their own, it can be passed (partially) from person to person at a fraction of the cost of gathering it ourselves, and in the process builds conceptual frameworks we could not otherwise raise on our own</li>
</ul>
<h2>00731</h2>
<ul>
<li>is all learning perceptual — beyond our conscious comprehension — and only explainable retrospectively in words and concepts? in other words, are our ideas of learning all very far from reality?</li>
</ul>
<h2>00631</h2>
<ul>
<li>why is it important to try to learn better? when we do not, we are stuck with the beliefs and attitudes we already have. we interpret our life experiences with the beliefs we hold — if those beliefs are very far from reality, the lessons we learn from our experiences will be as far from reality</li>
</ul>
<h2>00531</h2>
<ul>
<li>our educations are about learning to think, but we also need to unlearn, to learn to unthink.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00431</h2>
<ul>
<li>when someone no longer wants to learn, or no longer has the ability to learn, then you can only reason with them based on their current knowledge, rather than on what they might be learning or the trends in their knowledge. this makes most reasoning fruitless because they do not wish to learn knowledge that would enable them to understand beyond what they already know, and can thus only act according to their set patterns rather than more appropriately or responsibly to reality</li>
<li>similarly if they follow restrictive belief structures and authorities then they will be limited to those courses of belief and action</li>

<li>it isn't that everyone needs to achieve mastery of something. it is that when we do achieve mastery of something, we learn many things along the way that help us in our journey. in learning the piano, mostly on my own in a room, I learned, among other things, to: focus; move rapidly and precisely in near–darkness; vary goals to create and maintain challenge and progress; let go conscious thought and let action flow; slow breathing; express delicate and raw emotion; persist; listen to bodily reaction to know when something was as intended; extrapolate from sparse data; act without needing words; find and apply pattern; aim for long–term and short–term effectiveness; deal with changing conditions and abilities over time…</li>
</ul>
<h2>00131</h2>
<ul>
<li>just as memory is really recreation of an event, malleable each time it is recalled, so too is learning — learning is a malleable process, it is a recreation of a process, which changes each time someone learns something from someone else or internally.</li>
<li>learning is taking in reality and adjusting own internal reality to match. we are all innately able to learn but often abusive habits get in the way. like not truly seeing reality, but instead only our interpretation of it — only what matches our expectations or worldview. major corrective ability is the ability to question our own reality — does it correspond well with reality or not? when this ability is obstructed, then our internal world slips further and further from reality. abusive people know to increase this obstruction.</li>
<li>learning seems to be about recognising patterns, that we can use when meeting similar situations in future. for example, words, maths, communication; cycling, running, singing; evolution, diversity, thriving. it is all about removing the illusions that we hold about how well we can do something, learning new patterns that fit reality as it currently is, so that we can do things as well as we all really can.</li>
<li>ideas are the way they are because they haven’t gotten further yet, not because they are true. we do the best we can with what we have at this moment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>uncertainty principle of knowledge — the more you know about something, the less you can be sure you know matches reality</h2>
<h2>all knowledge is corrupted, but it does not mean it cannot still be useful</h2>
<h2>imperfect memory not ignorance but rather innocence</h2>
<h2>our vaunted human learning may be no more than a slightly tweaked imprinting. when was the last time you really saw a person change their entire system of thinking? it could be that we have the capacity to build one, and only one system in our life, and that is our one shot. how long do circumstances match that system, if indeed they ever do?</h2>
