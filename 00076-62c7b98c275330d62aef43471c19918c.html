We agreed with each other as to these and all such cases.<br />
To sum up then, Cleinias, I proceeded, it seems that, as regards the whole lot of things which at first we termed goods, the discussion they demand is not on the question of how they are in themselves and by nature goods, but rather, I conceive, as follows: if they are guided by ignorance, they are greater evils than their opposites, according as they are more capable of ministering to their evil guide; whereas if understanding and wisdom guide them,</p>
<p>[281e] they are greater goods; but in themselves neither sort is of any worth.<br />
I think the case appears, he replied, to be as you suggest.<br />
Now what result do we get from our statements? Is it not precisely that, of all the other things, not one is either good or bad, but of these two, wisdom is good and ignorance bad?</p>

<p>“the best way to help students change their conceptual outlook about scientific notions is to purposefully increase their cognitive dissonance until they feel so uncomfortable that they themselves seek out more information and new sources to resolve the conflict. This, of course, is not always possible—I doubt that it would have worked with Medea or Eichmann—but the notion provides us with a good understanding of both what is going on and what, if anything, can be done about it.”</p>

As he put it: “After ejection I had about 30 seconds to make my last statement in freedom before I landed on the main street of that little village right ahead.

Ignorance, or worse, self-deception about our own abilities can be very dangerous. We need to keep an up-to-date, accurate account of what is possible for us. This will depend not just on our abilities but also on the specific (and variable) physical and social environments in which we find ourselves at different times. Larry also counsels us to train ourselves to recognize when we have lost a good fit between our abilities and our activities. We must develop what he calls an internal alarm system, which will tell us when it’s time to stop suffering and begin (or resume) taking charge</li>

<p>changing your environment, for instance, by taking a physical break from the problematic situation; shifting the timing of your interaction with another person if the present moment seems not to be the best time to handle the problem, but being sure to set an alternative time for coming back to it in order to send the signal that you are not dodging it; practicing avoidance by not exposing yourself, if possible, to the cause of your distress; and finding alternative ways of doing what you need to do that may reduce the opportunity for conflict while still allowing you to accomplish your goals</p>

<p>Colin Killeen 1998: “[Loneliness] is such an innate part of the human psyche, that it cannot be solved like a puzzle; it can only be alleviated and made less painful. This can only be achieved by increasing humankind’s awareness of this distressing condition that everyone has to endure in some way, shape or form, sometime during their lives, about which there is nothing to be embarrassed.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But (save for pathological conditions, for which one needs to seek medical help), it is our choice, our own attitude, that turns solitude into loneliness. We may be alone, but we do not consequently need to feel helpless.</p>

<li>true friendship, like true love, is revealed when the going gets tough, not when things are nice and easy</li>
<li>if we use “love” and “friendship” to describe both situations in which morality is trumped and situations in which it is central, then we confuse things by not making semantic distinctions where there are substantive differences</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Stoic principles are as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtue is the highest good, and everything else is indifferent
<ul>
<li>The Stoics got the first part from Socrates, who argued that virtue is the chief good because it is the only thing that is valuable under all circumstances and that helps us make proper use of things like health, wealth, and education. Everything else is indifferent in the specifically Stoic sense that nothing is to be traded against virtue. The Stoic can pursue the preferred indifferents and try to stay away from the dispreferred ones, so long as doing so doesn’t interfere with virtue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Follow nature. That is, apply reason to social life.
<ul>
<li>The Stoics thought that we should take a hint from how the universe is put together in figuring out how to live our lives. Since human beings are naturally social animals capable of reason, it follows that we should strive to apply reason to achieve a better society.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dichotomy of control. Some things are under our control, and others are not (though we may be able to influence them).
<ul>
<li>If we are sufficiently healthy mentally, our decisions and behaviors are under our control. Outside of our control is everything else. We should concern ourselves with what is under our control and handle everything else with equanimity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Examine your impressions. “So make a practice at once of saying to every strong impression: ‘An impression is all you are, not the source of the impression.’ Then test and assess it with your criteria, but one primarily: ask, ‘Is this something that is, or is not, in my control?’ And if it’s not one of the things that you control, be ready with the reaction, ‘Then it’s none of my concern.’”</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Remind yourself of the impermanence of things. “In the case of particular things that delight you, or benefit you, or to which you have grown attached, remind yourself of what they are. Start with things of little value. If it is china you like, for instance, say, ‘I am fond of a piece of china.’ When it breaks, then you won’t be as disconcerted. When giving your wife or child a kiss, repeat to yourself, ‘I am kissing a mortal.’ Then you won’t be so distraught if they are taken from you.”</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>The reserve clause. “Whenever planning an action, mentally rehearse what the plan entails. If you are heading out to bathe, picture to yourself the typical scene at the bathhouse—people splashing, pushing, yelling and pinching your clothes. You will complete the act with more composure if you say at the outset, ‘I want a bath, but at the same time I want to keep my will aligned with nature’ [that is, to apply reason to social living]. Do it with every act. That way if something occurs to spoil your bath, you will have ready the thought, ‘Well, this was not my only intention, I also meant to keep my will in line with nature—which is impossible if I go all to pieces whenever anything bad happens.’”</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>How can I use virtue here and now? “For every challenge, remember the resources you have within you to cope with it. Provoked by the sight of a handsome man or a beautiful woman, you will discover within you the contrary power of self-restraint. Faced with pain, you will discover the power of endurance. If you are insulted, you will discover patience. In time, you will grow to be confident that there is not a single impression that you will not have the moral means to tolerate.”</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><em>apatheia</em>, which, despite the obvious and unappealing English echo, we have seen means tranquillity of mind, as well as equanimity toward whatever life happens to throw at us.</li>
<li>
<ol start="5">
<li>Pause and take a deep breath. “Remember, it is not enough to be hit or insulted to be harmed, you must believe that you are being harmed. If someone succeeds in provoking you, realize that your mind is complicit in the provocation. Which is why it is essential that we not respond impulsively to impressions; take a moment before reacting, and you will find it is easier to maintain control.”</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="6">
<li>Other-ize. “We can familiarize ourselves with the will of nature by calling to mind our common experiences. When a friend breaks a glass, we are quick to say, ‘Oh, bad luck.’ It’s only reasonable, then, that when a glass of your own breaks, you accept it in the same patient spirit. Moving on to graver things: when somebody’s wife or child dies, to a man we all routinely say, ‘Well, that’s part of life.’ But if one of our own family is involved, then right away it’s ‘Poor, poor me!’ We would do better to remember how we react when a similar loss afflicts others.”</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="7">
<li>Speak little and well. “Let silence be your goal for the most part; say only what is necessary, and be brief about it. On the rare occasions when you’re called upon to speak, then speak, but never about banalities like gladiators, horses, sports, food and drink—common-place stuff. Above all don’t gossip about people, praising, blaming or comparing them.”</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="8">
<li>Choose your company well. “Avoid fraternizing with non-philosophers. If you must, though, be careful not to sink to their level; because, you know, if a companion is dirty, his friends cannot help but get a little dirty too, no matter how clean they started out.”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>philosophers</em>: people who are interested in following virtue and cultivating their character</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="9">
<li>Respond to insults with humor. “If you learn that someone is speaking ill of you, don’t try to defend yourself against the rumors; respond instead with, ‘Yes, and he doesn’t know the half of it, because he could have said more.’”</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>the two approaches—working on eliminating or curtailing a problem while at the same time developing one’s own endurance—are simply not mutually exclusive. As a matter of fact, not only is there no need to choose one strategy or the other, but they can be reciprocally reinforcing. The more you train yourself to endure insults the stronger you feel psychologically, and therefore the more you can react appropriately and effectively, and vice versa: taking a stance against bullying enables you to see it for the infantile attitude that it really is (even, or especially, when engaged in by “adults”), and this insight then leads to the fostering of greater resilience.</li>
<li>
<ol start="10">
<li>Don’t speak too much about yourself. “In your conversation, don’t dwell at excessive length on your own deeds or adventures. Just because you enjoy recounting your exploits doesn’t mean that others derive the same pleasure from hearing about them.”</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="11">
<li>Speak without judging. “Someone bathes in haste; don’t say he bathes badly, but in haste. Someone drinks a lot of wine; don’t say he drinks badly, but a lot. Until you know their reasons, how do you know that their actions are vicious? This will save you from perceiving one thing clearly, but then assenting to something different.”</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="12">
<li>Reflect on your day. “Admit not sleep into your tender eyelids till you have reckoned up each deed of the day—How have I erred, what done or left undone? So start, and so review your acts, and then for vile deeds chide yourself, for good be glad.”</li>
</ol>

<p>“the deep sense that not everything that happens is about you. It might seem that getting the sense that life isn’t about you is a downer, but this is what makes modesty life-affirming. Dropping the feeling that life has to be about you means opening up to all the other great things life can be about. It allows you to connect with others more deeply, and feel like a more integrated part of the world. When you’re not as invested in being better than others, you stop looking at the internal scoreboard so often, and when you do that, your gaze can wander to better places.”</p>

<li>In this paper we emphasize that 1/<em>f</em> noise has two different origins, one compatible with Laplace determinism and one determined by unpredictable crucial events. The dynamics of heartbeats, manifest as heart rate variability (HRV) time series, are determined by the joint action of these different memory sources with meditation turning the Laplace memory into a strongly coherent process while exerting an action on the crucial events favoring the transition from the condition of ideal 1/<em>f</em> noise to the Gaussian basin of attraction. This theoretical development affords a method of statistical analysis that establishes a quantitative approach to the evaluation of the stress reduction realized by the practice of Chi meditation and Kundalini Yoga.</li>

<p>Participants in the study, a mixture of experienced, novice and non-meditators, were trained to select images associated with a reward. Each pair of images had varying probabilities of a reward e.g. images that result in a reward 80 per cent of the time versus those that result in a reward 20 per cent of the time. Participants eventually learnt to select the pairing with the higher outcome.</p>
<p>Researchers found that participants who meditated were more successful in selecting high-probability pairings indicating a tendency to learn from positive outcomes, compared to non -- meditators who learned the pattern via low-probability pairings suggesting a tendency to learn from negative outcomes.</p>
<p>During the study participants were connected to an EEG, a non-invasive method that records electrical patterns in the brain. Results from the EEG found that while all three groups responded similarly to positive feedback, the neurological response to negative feedback was highest in the non-meditation group, followed by the novice group and then by the experienced meditation group. These results indicate that the brains of meditators are less affected by negative feedback, and that this may be a result of altered dopamine levels caused by meditation.</p>
<p>Previous studies in this field on patients with Parkinson's disease, where dopamine levels are severely reduced, have shown that the compound affects how people respond to feedback, indicating that dopamine is integral to how we learn and process information. The present study suggests that meditation may present a way to affect levels of dopamine in the brain and the way humans deal with positive and negative feedback.</p>
<p>Paul Knytl, lead author and PhD candidate in psychology at the University of Surrey, said: &quot;Humans have been meditating for over 2000 years, but the neural mechanisms of this practice are still relatively unknown. These findings demonstrate that, on a deep level, meditators respond to feedback in a more even-handed way than non-meditators, which may help to explain some of the psychological benefits they experience from the practice.&quot;</p>
<p>Bertram Opitz, Professor in Neuroimaging and Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Surrey, said: &quot;Meditation is a powerful tool for the body and the mind; it can reduce stress and improve immune function. What we have found is that it can also impact on how we receive feedback, i.e. if we quickly learn from our mistakes or if we need to keep making them before we find the right answer.</p>
<p>&quot;If it is the latter this can impact how individuals perform in the workplace or classroom. Such individuals may benefit from meditation to increase their productivity or prevent them from falling behind in their studies.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Focused attention meditation (FAM) practices are cognitive control exercises where meditators learn to maintain focus and attention in the face of distracting stimuli. Previous studies have shown that FAM is both activating and causing plastic changes to the mesolimbic dopamine system and some of its target structures, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum. Feedback-based learning also depends on these systems and is known to be modulated by tonic dopamine levels. Capitalizing on previous findings that FAM practices seem to cause dopamine release, the present study shows that FAM experience predicts learning from negative feedback on a probabilistic selection task. Furthermore, meditators exhibited attenuated feedback-related negativity (FRN) as compared with nonmeditators and this effect scales with meditation experience. Given that reinforcement learning and FRN are modulated by dopamine levels, a possible explanation for our findings is that FAM practice causes persistent increases in tonic dopamine levels which scale with amount of practice, thus altering feedback processing.</p>

<p><em>from military member to student: an examination of the communicative challenges of veterans to perform communication accommodation in the university</em><br />
william t. howe, maria shpeer 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17475759.2019.1592770">http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17475759.2019.1592770</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>interviewed 20 ex service personnel who attend the University of Oklahoma. His study, published in the Journal of Intercultural Communication Research found that despite veterans being the same age as other college students, military service had instilled them with vastly different cultural values, which meant they experienced 'cultural shock' when going from a military environment to a college campus. Interestingly this was true for both combat and non-combat veterans, suggesting that it is not combat that is making it difficult for veterans to return to civilian life, but military training and an adoption of military culture.</p>
<p>&quot;Veterans have been through tougher times, even in basic training alone, than many people may realise, therefore to them complaining about writing a paper is silly when they compare it to their past experiences of facing death,&quot; says Howe.</p>
<p>As well as being unable to relate to civilians feeling stress over 'trivial' matters like exams, ex military personnel were often upset by the way their classmates dressed, and their perceived lack of respect towards authority figures.</p>
<p>&quot;In the military good hygiene, grooming, and making sure your clothes are clean and professional are of vital importance, so to a veteran, students coming to class not groomed properly, or in clothes that they perceive as being too casual conflicts with their military values,&quot; says Howe.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, while lecturers at university often encourage open discussion, this is distinctly different from what veterans experienced in the military, where communication is top-down and upward dissent is discouraged. Veterans often got angry when other students talked during lectures.&quot;</p>
<p>Finally, while most students enjoyed talking about politics, veterans were very uncomfortable and unwilling to do this. &quot;The United States Military has very conservative and strict rules that individuals must abide by. For example they are not allowed to criticise the President -- doing so could result in forfeiture of pay, dishonorable discharge, and even imprisonment&quot; says Howe.</p>
<p>The culture clash was often exacerbated by differences in the style of language used by veterans and civilians. For example veterans often used military jargon and acronyms when interacting with civilians, and would grow frustrated when other students couldn't understand them. Veterans also felt that the profanities and dark humor they used was often misinterpreted by civilians and seen as crude and vulgar when, for the veterans, this was a normal way of speaking.</p>
<p>&quot;Another issue was the directness of communication by veterans,&quot; says Howe. &quot;In the army it is seen as natural to say &quot;do this&quot; and expect others to do it. However this sort of speech usually resulted in the veterans being disliked by others and ostracized from the group.&quot;</p>
<p>The study showed that veterans responded to this culture clash in three separate ways: by trying to see things from the perspective of the other students, by verbally lashing out and confronting the person, and finally by remaining silent.</p>
<p>By far the most commonly used strategy was silence: 100% of veterans interviewed said that they often kept quiet or refused to speak their mind in class. The reasons for this varied from not wanting to talk about politics to being afraid of getting in trouble for saying something others would perceive as inappropriate. However eventually some veterans erupted and had verbal conflicts with others.</p>
<p>&quot;Many veterans entered a 'spiral of silence', and in doing so continued to feel more and more isolated,&quot; says Howe. &quot;Any prolonged silence about a troubling issue is not good for an individual, and the worry is that this extreme isolation could lead to a feeling that life is not worth living and a decision to permanently silence themselves with suicide.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Howe the findings show that more needs to be done to help veterans and civilians understand one another, and to reintegrate veterans into society.</p>
<p>&quot;The military takes 8-12 weeks to strip military members of their civilian culture and replace it with a military culture. To not spend the same time and effort to reverse the process at the end of a servicemember's time in uniform is irresponsible,&quot; says Howe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> This study examined the transition of veterans from the military to the classroom. Guided by communication accommodation theory (CAT), results of semi-structured interviews (N = 20) of military veterans were analyzed to see how and why participants described communication approaches in the university setting. Approaches appeared guided by inculcated values developed during earlier cultural experiences, in the military. Participants described interpersonal and group communication exchanges in three broad themes: cultural clash, perspective taking, and self-silencing. This research supports prior psychological research that explored difficulties combat veterans face after exit and extends this research to non-combat veterans from a communicative perspective.</p>

<p><em>rumination selectively mediates the association between actual-ideal (but not actual-ought) self-discrepancy and anxious and depressive symptoms</em><br />
joanne m. dickson et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2019.05.047">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2019.05.047</a></p>

<p>it's not failing to make progress toward our 'ideal-self' that is problematic but rather the tendency to focus on that lack of progress in a negative way that leads to psychological distress.</p>
<p>In other words, it pays to be kind to yourself, say the key researchers.</p>
<p>The study, led by Associate Professor Joanne Dickson from ECU's School of Arts and Humanities, explored whether 'ideal-self' and 'actual-self' discrepancies were associated with depressive and anxious symptoms.</p>
<p>It also considered whether 'rumination', or excessive negative thinking, played a role in these relationships.</p>
<p>Professor Dickson said there are two key 'self-guides' that typically motivate us and provide standards for self-evaluation: the 'ideal-self' and the 'ought-self'.</p>
<p>&quot;The 'ideal-self' is the person we ideally want to be -- our hopes and aspirations. The 'ought self' is who we believe we ought to be -- our duties, obligations, and responsibilities,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our findings showed that perceiving one's hopes and wishes as unfulfilled and the loss of desired positive outcomes increases emotional vulnerability and psychological distress.</p>
<p>&quot;Whereas actual-ought self-discrepancies were associated with anxiety (but not depression).&quot;</p>
<p>The role of excessive negative thinking</p>
<p>Professor Dickson said a novel finding was the role of 'rumination', the tendency to engage in repetitive negative thinking.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not failing to make progress toward our 'ideal-self' that is necessarily problematic but rather the tendency to repetitively think about this lack of progress that represents a significant vulnerability that, in turn, leads to increased psychological distress,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>In contrast, lack of progress in relation to our 'ought self' (ie duties, responsibilities, obligations) directly increased anxiety (but not depression), and this was not facilitated via repetitive thinking.</p>
<p>&quot;It may be that fulfilling obligations, duties and responsibilities is more pressing or urgent than the pursuit of hopes and the more immediate negative consequences of not fulfilling these 'ought to' obligations may mean there is less time to engage in reflective contemplation,&quot; Professor Dickson said.</p>
<p>Advice for minimising psychological distress</p>
<p>Professor Dickson said self-guides as standards that we aspire to are beneficial in giving a sense of purpose and direction in life and promoting wellbeing, even if we don't always reach them, but turning the focus toward negative self-evaluation and self-criticism is counter-productive.</p>
<p>&quot;Reflecting on and at times modifying our self-guides may be helpful, particularly if we are caught in a spiral of negative self-evaluation that is accompanied by a constant sense of failing to meet overly high standards.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to be kind to ourselves and keep our self-guides in perspective,&quot; she said.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Actual-ideal and actual-ought self-discrepancies have been theorised to be independently associated with depressive and anxious symptoms respectively. This study tested this prediction and extended it to consider whether rumination mediates these relationships. One hundred and thirty-eight students (48 males, 90 females) listed four adjectives describing how they would ideally hope to be and four adjectives describing how they ought to be. Participants then rated how distant they perceived themselves to be from each of their ideal and ought selves, as well as the importance of each ideal and ought self. Finally, participants self-reported levels of negative rumination, anxious and depressive symptoms. Actual-ideal self-discrepancy was independently associated with both anxious and depressive symptoms, whereas actual-ought self-discrepancy was independently associated with anxious symptoms only. Rumination mediated the independent relationships between actual-ideal self-discrepancy and anxious and depressive symptoms. Actual-ought self-discrepancy retained an independent association with anxious symptoms that was not mediated through rumination. Anxious and depressive symptoms both have independent associations with actual-ideal self-discrepancies, whereas anxious symptoms are uniquely associated with actual-ought self-discrepancies. We reveal further evidence for rumination as a cognitive-motivational transdiagnostic process linking self-regulatory difficulties with anxious and depressive symptoms.</p>

<p><em>structural balance emerges and explains performance in risky decision-making</em><br />
omid askarisichani et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10548-8">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10548-8</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the first longitudinal study to prove several key tenants of structural balance theory (SBT), which provides an analytical framework to characterize how relationships change over time. SBT consists of four primary rules for relationships among individuals:</p>
<p>A friend of a friend is a friend<br />
A friend of an enemy is an enemy<br />
An enemy of an enemy is a friend<br />
An enemy of a friend is an enemy<br />
When all of these conditions are met, a network is said to be balanced. Through a two-year study of day traders, the researchers found that: (A) workers gravitate toward a state of balance in their relationships; and (B) performance improves when there is a high level of balance.</p>
<p>&quot;This data shows that companies reap the benefits when conflict among employees is reduced,&quot; said corresponding author Brian Uzzi, the Richard L. Thomas Professor of Leadership and Organizational Change in Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management. &quot;There are certain types of conflict that can't resolve themselves. This work can help managers identify those conflicts and actively step in to resolve them, ultimately leading to better performance.&quot;</p>
<p>From 2007 to 2009, researchers analyzed day traders' instant messages to determine the relationships among traders and compared those relationships to performance data for individual traders, controlling for factors including market volatility and work days. They found that the traders with the highest level of balance in their networks also made the best trades, regardless of the objective level of talent of any individual trader.</p>
<p>&quot;We suspect that conflict in networks monopolizes some portion of workers' mental energy,&quot; Uzzi said. &quot;Resolving that conflict frees up mental energy to make better decisions and perform at a higher level.&quot;</p>
<p>The findings of this study apply to individuals who engage in extensive high-risk decision making, particularly in situations where polarization is common, such as politics or in the military.</p>
<p>Further research is needed to determine whether the same rules hold in other work situations, such as creative and innovative endeavors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Polarization affects many forms of social organization. A key issue focuses on which affective relationships are prone to change and how their change relates to performance. In this study, we analyze a financial institutional over a two-year period that employed 66 day traders, focusing on links between changes in affective relations and trading performance. Traders’ affective relations were inferred from their IMs (&gt;2 million messages) and trading performance was measured from profit and loss statements (&gt;1 million trades). Here, we find that triads of relationships, the building blocks of larger social structures, have a propensity towards affective balance, but one unbalanced configuration resists change. Further, balance is positively related to performance. Traders with balanced networks have the “hot hand”, showing streaks of high performance. Research implications focus on how changes in polarization relate to performance and polarized states can depolarize.</p>
