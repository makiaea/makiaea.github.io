<li>self sacrifice of friend who is faery who can block energy pulse by body – she can sit on energy tank and shield it from attack while controlling it to fire</li>
<li>she comes to save us from our deadly pursuer, a smaller faery type who reaches for us to destroy us by touch. in orbit she finds us one last time, but says nothing. we see her open mouth to take something in, and wrap her hair around the stinging strands that remain invisible but potent. one strand sears me. she points to the earth to tell us to see what is happening down there, all the other parts are gathered and the rising is causing dark forces to sweep towards it. as we look to the earth, she silently dies choking behind us on the faery pursuer, the one that almost reached us as we left earth, as our friend at that time turned the transparent blue tent into a soaring clear red manta ray with her perch on nose, that evil one grasped for her from similar smaller one behind but stingers not long enough and our speed faster so we just manage to get out of reach in slow motion. this time was not so easy. our friend who looks like engineer in firefly, dies to keep us safe and yet we all still feel the insane evil energy of the dark lord even from high orbit.</li>
<li>123–6–9 is trinary beginning sequence.</li>
<li>the little pack of drawing pins rattles in its paper bag and it's hard not to imagine that one may be a part of the dark lord seeking to return to his body on earth.</li>

<li>
<p>zombie, unicorn, hero<br />
the unspoken war</p>
<ul>
<li>ancient zombies are a part of us, just like vampires.</li>
<li>this is also why our age is obsessed with dreams and spells and other things that represent the conflict between what we are becoming and what we need to be.</li>
<li>the unspoken war is against the other, the foe, who is not really the devil, but just the selves we are liable to become. so monotheist warnings of the devil, buddhist warnings of unenlightenment, warning of vampire or zombie apocalypse, all represent the war against the other, which is really the war against ourselves.</li>
<li>so this isn't a zombie defense kit, not a zombie innoculation kit, but a zombie vaccine kit, a zombie cure kit.</li>
</ul>

<li>soon your own poisons will consume you from within. and you will die a miserable, lonely death.</li>
<li>do you wish to know the cure for your affliction?</li>
<li>it will not be easy for you, no matter how well–prepared you are.</li>
<li>the humans of this world need to go on a journey.</li>
<li>on your journey you will learn not the secret of eternal life but the way to transmute poison to health and life.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2>05482</h2>
<ul>
<li>finals and cicadas
<ul>
<li>I'm in the middle of my finals, I'm crabby because I haven't had enough sleep. can't tell you anything, because you're a fresher. wait, did you see that? some sort of insect is growing in the soil of that plant on the workbench. whoa, they seem to be emerging super fast, like a speeded–up nature programme. wait, those are cicadas — they shouldn't be that quick — something is wrong. they are not super fast, we are super slow! we'd better go tell the teachers. which way is the staff room? I'll show you. we'd better speed up our legs using a speed spell in case this is something serious and they need to know right away.</li>
<li>you go on inside and tell them, I'll just have a little rest here. what, they said it was all right, but didn't say what it was? hmm… I'd better go ask. good morning sir, is it what I suspect? thought it might be something at the end of stage two, yes sir. I'll finish up my first day as soon as I can. thank you sir. oh yeah they told me. it's just a temporary intermittent thing, they said. nothing to worry about. but I can't tell you anything or I'll be expelled — never tell a fresher anything about the finals. wait, does that count?</li>
<li>hey look, that's c. lord lurking around outside our lab door. he isn't allowed in, some sort of restraining order. but I bet he's up to no good. he's super keen on engineering but did something bad so he's not allowed in even though usually everyone is. I heard he'd been banned from all SISU facilities, and that would mean all things space–related, system–wide, like our lab. poor guy must be feeling so deprived. all the exciting stuff is at SISU nowadays. wouldn't be beyond him to try rolling in some spy drone balls, though I think the lab has a way of detecting those if they come on their own. more likely some sort of social attack vector, like attaching a drone to one of us as we go into the lab.</li>
<li>I'd better get on with my finals I suppose. was just taking a breather because it got all weird toward the end of day one. watch out for that c. lord character, make sure he doesn't try any mischief. knowing my luck, I'm probably the one he attached the drone to. see you later!</li>
<li>yes, that did look like a tracker on their back, the shiny, spherical thing. sounds like it will get scraped off pretty quick during their finals. never mind, I'm sure it's okay. now where were we? back to the lesson with the soil. can't tell a fresher anything — if they said that phrase again I would have given them a piece of my mind! just because they are a third year and think they know everything. it was majorly weird about the cicadas though — never seen anything like that before. must be only our sense of time is affected, otherwise how could we still walk? we'd just fall over otherwise, wouldn't we? probably something about the nature of time being in the waking mind whereas walking is done by the autonomous mind or something like that I seem to remember from one lecture.</li>

<h2>05582</h2>
<ul>
<li>game of psyche
<ul>
<li>every refugee group has relevant tale to tell, each one representing something in the psyche</li>
<li>premise is a handmade game that friend invites us to play for their 30th birthday party</li>
<li>Godzilla has tendency to want to eat marble, so place marble in the mouth of another plastic toy and by moving Godzilla backwards and forwards and to and fro got him to eat the marble from the other toy’s mouth</li>
<li>series of tests in the newsagent represent mental resilience, like lottery ticket showing luck</li>
<li>a corrupt official needs your help, they are mentally ill for some reason but trust you to help them because you are the friend of the friend who is hosting the sleepover party. they need food but you can't find any because the hotel staff are off shift. one choice is taking them to the public conference and eating from the buffet but then they would be publicly exposed as ill. not a great idea for their image …</li>
<li>one day is on the floating tent in the middle of a pond. our clothes are drying on the tent–shaped float. we hear odd weird moaning noises. the mer children have taken over our float and won't leave it. I have a pencil in hand and pretend to be an offended fairy who casts a spell on them, turning each of them into the person they detest the most. for some reason the tent is spinning in the water and this seems to work…</li>
<li>each scenario is of a set of people in a location like in the newsagents. they represent certain characteristics of ourselves. ostensibly each is just a game scenario but they represent fundamental aspects of what we are. like the pensioner who wants to buy a lottery ticket represents luck, or the shopkeeper who wants to remember the items the customer bought and ring up the purchase correctly. essentially we go somewhere, a shop or a location, and time is suddenly suspended, and each person in the situation requires your help with something, and that is the hand made game that we play as part of the 30th birthday celebration</li>
<li>for example the dictator represents our helpful instincts versus our belief in what someone has told us about someone else — how do we know to judge them as corrupt? it is because of what someone told us, not what we have seen ourselves</li>
<li>same could be said of a wicked witch — but what about real wicked witches who would trick you into getting eaten up — what about them?</li>

<li>the museum of the lost
<ul>
<li>Would you do a job if you knew it was one hundred percent fatal? Like, messily and quickly? Silly me, I used to wonder why the museum collection was in such a state but then I realised its keepers were being killed, not just going missing.</li>
<li>If you’re wondening what such a naive lover of living things is doing in a cavern of old dusty moldering dead things — well, I worked my way up from cleaning toilets, and it’s not really talked about, you’re just supposed to know.</li>
<li>After all, aren’t all things guaranteed to be fatal, in the long run? If I’m doing something which is helpful in the meantime, and I’ve little hope of finding someone to raise kids and grow old with (my friends say someday, keep hoping), the next best thing is bringing back to the world what has been lost</li>
<li>you see, all things have a story, a reason why they came to be, and that’s why we are so fascinated by them.</li>

<li>invoking a spell
<ul>
<li>to invoke, we are drawing from past experience and processes in order to move forward with something. the only way to convey information is to invoke.</li>
<li>even the most powerful spells are but words when they cannot invoke in us the feeling and emotion they are intended to convey.</li>
<li>this is the true meaning of sensitivity. being able to respond to invocation. it is not a simple physical response.</li>
<li>being able to invoke without saying a spell, that is the ultimate magic in some stories because it is a story–form of our greatest challenge.</li>
<li>from a magical invoking melody, to the memory of that melody, to invoking without the melody. that is also the magic of love, the magic of trust.</li>
<li>write about being open to the power of dreams. not taking them literally but how they can process what we learn into something that can invoke, that we can invoke.</li>

<li>maybe it is maleficent, hobbling without her wings, and in the struggle she is held, strangled, until the passing light blends her silhouette with the shadow of a (prefigured) bird, and she regains her wings and wins.</li>
<li>animation short: see children's book fall open to the floor. the pages subtly arrange themselves. the combined pages flash, you see the silhouette of a hag. the hag rises, and searches out the sleeping child. you feel that something awful is going to happen…</li>
<li>you hear the sleeping child, and just as you see it come in view you also see that the silhouette holding the long dagger above it is not the hag but a soldier! the hag tussles with the other, somehow overpowering it, rescuing the child, but being killed itself, silently.</li>

<li>Magic is alive. magic is everywhere.
<ul>
<li>it's not that spells and sorcery have disappeared, they have just disappeared from view. they are still there, we just call them by different names. science, psychology, law, finance. the same rules still apply, people still use them in the way they always have. some to seek personal gain, power, fame or fortune, some to aid, nourish and cherish our world.</li>

<li>As for words, words are magical things. In this world, there are many kinds of magic, and words are some of the oldest, and most powerful. These words before you were written long ago, in the hope that someday, somehow, they will help you on your journey. The journeys we each have before us are long and lively ones – let us begin our journey now.</li>
