<h2>the three stages</h2>
<h2>05003</h2>
<ul>
<li>scroll, shield, and spear — how knowledge, change, and diversity help us thrive.
<ul>
<li>scroll, shield, and spear: on knowledge and ignorance, thinking and unthinking, action and inaction; in evolution, our relationships, and the future of the earth</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>05103</h2>
<ul>
<li>the book, the mirror, and the sword: knowing and unknowing, reflecting and creating, acting and waiting
<ul>
<li>on knowledge and ignorance, on creation and reflection, on action and inaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>05203</h2>
<ul>
<li>cf. stuart chase
<ul>
<li>word/symbol level: the way that can be told is not the way — language, mathematics, concepts, evolution, diversity, probability, are all descriptions of how we believe the world to be.</li>
<li>reflection/thought level: one becomes two, becomes many — if reality is similar to what we describe as probabilistic, then the concept of diversity is a useful relative guide to “action” and “decision–making”.</li>
<li>object/referent level: tao, reality. we can only describe our beliefs about reality, but what we do, how we act, directly affects reality. burning fossil fuels changes the composition of the atmosphere and alters the climate of the earth. lying and abusing others suppresses their ability to deal their beliefs and thus their ability to deal with reality. recalling the concept of diverse–probabilistic helps us to deal with our beliefs and thus our ability to deal with reality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>05303</h2>
<ul>
<li>changing reality: choose — explore and evaluate for best contribution, choose what matters — eliminate nonessential, and do — make process for getting things done easily.
<ul>
<li>
<p>choose</p>
<ul>
<li>origin of issue: “learned helplessness”,<br />
lack of belief in ability to choose — believe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>discern</p>
<ul>
<li>issue origin: not comparing value of different actions nor choosing to do valuable actions — 80/20 guide to nonessential/valuable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>do</p>
<ul>
<li>issue origin: not creating process to allows us to get things done easily, assuming ability or circumstance will do it — make process.</li>

<ul>
<li>caged child, bear trap, shackles
<ul>
<li>words are the key to free us from the first beartraps. but they are the prison that keeps us caged in the second. the mirror of reflection is the key to freeing us from the second prison but is the shackle that keeps us enslaved in the third. the sword of action is the key to freeing us from the shackles of the third prison. we must be vigilant that it does not become our last trap.</li>
<li>the words reveal paths around the lethal obstacles that would kill us instantly. but words create an invisible prison in our minds. the light of the mirror melts the invisible prison. but the bright light creates its own shackles, limiting us to what we can see. the sword shatters the mirror and symbolizes the fight for freedom which we are born to fight. forever.</li>
<li>when we don't have the words to describe something. when the light of the mirror hides the truth because we no longer see what is not in the light. when the sword becomes the symbol of our fight for freedom and at the same time the new cage which captures us.</li>
<li>sword is the symbol of freedom yet is one of the symbols that keep us enslaved.</li>

<li>the book of antiquity
<ul>
<li>or, the word, or the message arrives how or what do we need to learn? The book/a gateway to knowledge</li>
<li>How much of past can we truly learn? The past is gone, and thousands of years of sarcomata remain. But we can, with imagination, learn something from the past. In part 1, &quot;the book&quot;, we will deal with ways to find and absorb knowledge.</li>
<li>Current textbooks are too absorbed by authority and repetition. We assume you can grasp a concept immediately, or else know to ponder over something and come back at it.</li>

<li>In part 2 of the book, &quot;the mirror&quot;, we will be looking at future trends and appropriate methods for dealing with them. Here we deal with ways to interpret, understand and use knowledge.</li>
<li>Possible topics include responsibility, evolution, ecocide as crime, family structure, peak oil.</li>

<li>or, the battle</li>
<li>how or what to we need to act? The sword/a gateway to action</li>
<li>The principle of understanding and working with the flow of natural processes helps us make good use of our resources. It is like when your hand is caught by a cat's claws when you play together — if you know to move towards the cat's paws, rather than away. Moving towards means that the claws can no longer grip you, since they are pointed towards the cat, while moving away helps strengthen the grip and may even help to cause damage if moving away sufficiently quickly. Similar types of principles are espoused in aikido and zen meditation. We will be approaching some everyday processes from this point of view in part 3 of the book, &quot;the sword&quot;.</li>
