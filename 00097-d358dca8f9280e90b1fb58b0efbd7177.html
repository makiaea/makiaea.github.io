<p><em>tolerance to ambiguous uncertainty predicts prosocial behavior</em><br />
marc-lluís vives, oriel feldmanhall 2018<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04631-9">doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04631-9</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Uncertainty is a fundamental feature of human life that can be fractioned into two distinct psychological constructs: risk (known probabilistic outcomes) and ambiguity (unknown probabilistic outcomes). Although risk and ambiguity are known to powerfully bias nonsocial decision-making, their influence on prosocial behavior remains largely unexplored. Here we show that ambiguity attitudes, but not risk attitudes, predict prosocial behavior: the greater an individual’s ambiguity tolerance, the more they engage in costly prosocial behaviors, both during decisions to cooperate (experiments 1 and 3) and choices to trust (experiment 2). Once the ambiguity associated with another’s actions is sufficiently resolved, this relationship between ambiguity tolerance and prosocial choice is eliminated (experiment 3). Taken together, these results provide converging evidence that attitudes toward ambiguity are a robust predictor of one’s willingness to engage in costly social behavior, which suggests a mechanism for the underlying motivations of prosocial action.</li>

<ul>
<li>We commonly think of information as a means to an end. However, a growing theoretical and experimental literature suggests that information may directly enter the agent's utility function. This can create an incentive to avoid information, even when it is useful, free, and independent of strategic considerations. We review research documenting the occurrence of information avoidance, as well as theoretical and empirical research on reasons why people avoid information, drawing from economics, psychology, and other disciplines. The review concludes with a discussion of some of the diverse (and often costly) individual and societal consequences of information avoidance.</li>

<p><em>hypocognition: making sense of the world beyond one’s conceptual reach</em><br />
wu, k., &amp; dunning, d 2018 <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319974334_hypocognition_making_sense_of_the_landscape_beyond_one%27s_conceptual_reach">pdf</a><br />

<ul>
<li>
<p>Does Action Require Meaning?<br />
But our discussion of hypocognition leads to a rather pointed question: To act, do people necessarily need meaning? As our Fijian example about pregnant women and toxic fish suggests, significant actions at times may require no explicit meaning or rationale for people to guide people to execute them (Henrich &amp; Henrich, 2010). Our discussion of Gettier cases suggests, too, that actions may follow from spurious or mistaken understandings of circumstances that just happen to lead to adaptive behavior.<br />
After all, across human history, people have lived their lives just fine without the aid of concepts we enjoy in our modern life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> People think, feel, and behave within the confines of what they can conceive. Outside that conceptual landscape, people exhibit hypocognition (i.e., lacking cognitive or linguistic representations of concepts to describe ideas or explicate experiences). We review research on the implications of hypocognition for cognition and behavior. Drawing on the expertise and cross-cultural literatures, we describe how hypocognition impoverishes one’s mental world, leaving cognitive deficits in recognition, explanation, and memory while fueling social chauvinism and conflict in political and cultural spheres. Despite its pervasive consequences, people cannot be expected to identify when they are in a hypocognitive state, mistaking what they conceive for the totality of all that there is. To the extent that their channel of knowledge becomes too narrow, people risk submitting to hypocognition’s counterpart, hypercognition (i.e., the mistaken overapplication of other available conceptual notions to issues outside their actual relevance).</p>

<p><em>hypocognition and the invisibility of social privilege</em><br />
kaidi wu, david dunning 2020</p>
<ul>
<li><em>abstract</em> Are members of socially dominant groups aware of the privileges they enjoy?<br />
We address this question by applying the notion of hypocognition to social privilege. Hypocognition is defined as lacking a rich cognitive or linguistic representation (i.e., a schema) of a concept in question. By social privilege, we refer to advantages that members of dominant social groups enjoy because of their group membership. We argue that such group members are hypocognitive of the privilege they enjoy. They have little cognitive representation of it. As a consequence, their social advantage is invisible to them.<br />
Approach. We provide a narrative review of recent empirical work demonstrating and explaining this lack of expertise and knowledge in socially dominant groups (e.g., Whites, men) about discrimination and disadvantage encountered by other groups (e.g., Blacks, Asian Americans, women), relative what members of those other groups know.<br />
Findings. This lack of expertise or knowledge is revealed by classic cognitive psychological measures. Relative to members of other groups, social dominant group members generate fewer examples of discrimination that other groups confront, remember fewer instances after being presented a list of them, and are slower to respond when classifying whether these examples are discriminatory.<br />
Social Implications. These classic measures of cognitive expertise about social privilege predict social attitude differences between social groups, specifically whether people perceive the existence of social privilege as well as believe discrimination still exists in contemporary society. Hypocognition of social privilege also carries implications for informal interventions (e.g., acting “colorblind”) that are popularly discussed.</li>

<p><em>ignorance as an under-identified social problem</em><br />

<ul>
<li>“Ungar argues that the issue of public ignorance is, regrettably, not a “marketable issue.” Among his reasons: there is no clearly discernible class of victims who can organize and drive for reform. I would add that when the problem is identified, the all-too-common knee-jerk response is to blame schooling and ascribe stupidity.”</li>
<li><em>abstract</em> This paper examines the persistence and intensification of ignorance in the ostensible knowledge society. Given the ubiquity of ignorance, it focuses on research and observations dealing with functional knowledge deficits that challenge the ideal of the well‐informed citizen. These developments are traced back to the contradictory dynamics of the knowledge society, specifically information explosions in the knowledge economy and the resultant knowledge–ignorance paradox. The theoretical unfolding of this paradox in terms of entry and speech barriers suggests that pockets of observed public knowledge – rather than ignorance – are exceptional and require specific explanation. While ignorance among individuals, as well as experts and organizations, is a serious social problem with potentially deadly consequences, ignorance remains relatively unrecognized since it has major liabilities as a marketable issue. The conclusion points to the importance of future research on the cultural and institutional production of ignorance.</li>

<p><em>is justified true belief knowledge?</em><br />
edmund gettier 1963<br />
analysis 23, no. 6: 121–123</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In 1963, this game was shockingly disrupted by a tidy, three-page article. It is Edmund Gettier III’s one and only publication.1 He simply presented cases in which even justified true belief was not sufficient for knowing something “in the strong sense,” that is, for genuine knowledge. How could that be?</p>
<p>Imagine, for example, that Jim believes the Red Sox beat the Yankees today by a score of 4 to 3, and in fact they did; Jim learned this by watching the game on TV. Thus Jim’s belief is in fact true and he has reasonable justification for his belief. Here is the problem: unbeknownst to Jim, what he watched was a rebroadcast of yesterday’s game—in which it also happened that the Red Sox beat the Yankees by the same score. So, Jim does not really know who won today’s game, not in the “strong sense.”</p>
<p>In Gettier’s problematic situations, there is a mere coincidence between one’s epistemic judgment and the facts: we do not really possess the knowledge we think we do. In Jim’s case, unknown unknowns were in play; his justified true belief was a matter of epistemic luck. Typically, Gettier cases postulate both one’s ignorance of relevant factors and one’s luck in meeting the justified, true belief conditions notwithstanding that ignorance. How can we exclude such circumstances? Unfortunately, Gettier did not develop a solution; he just let loose the force of his examples.</p>

<p><em>epistemic luck</em><br />
duncan pritchard 2005</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nonetheless, in common human experience, luck is indeed a factor in our coming to know, and our ignorance is also often a matter of luck. Duncan Pritchard, drawing on the work of Peter Unger, has identified three types of “benign” epistemic luck and has proposed a fourth. (1) There is content epistemic luck: it is lucky that the proposition is true, that the Red Sox won, in my example. (2) Second, there is capacity epistemic luck: it is lucky that Jim is capable of knowing the outcome of the game. (3) There is evidential epistemic luck: it is lucky that Jim happened to see the game on TV. This condition presumably describes cases like those discussed earlier (chapter 9) in which some historical traces have survived by luck, despite the loss of others. (4) Pritchard also teases out doxastic epistemic luck, in which it is lucky that the believer believes the proposition: it is lucky that Tim believes the Red Sox won. These are, Pritchard asserts, unproblematic for genuine knowledge. But another type is of concern: (5) veritic epistemic luck, in which it is a matter of luck that the belief is true.3 Veritic luck is at play in Gettier-type cases, and Pritchard thinks it is fatal to genuine knowledge and must be eliminated. While it seems clear that Gettier-type cases do involve veritic luck—it was a matter of luck that Jim’s belief about who won the game was true—we might also analyze the case as a matter of (bad) evidential luck: perhaps it was unlucky that Jim didn’t happen to watch the screen when the notice appeared that it was a rebroadcast.</p>
<p>( Pritchard also identifies a fifth type of epistemic luck as problematic: (5) reflective epistemic luck, in which, “given what the agent is able to know by reflection alone, it is a matter of luck that her belief is true” (Epistemic Luck, 175). This type is directed toward internalist accounts of knowledge—accounts that take the justification of beliefs to be solely a matter of the believer’s internal, cognitive states. )</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inspofar as human knowledge is a social construct in this profound sense, so is ignorance. This means that our new knowledge creates our ignorance: it does not simply identify unknowns that were lurking among the unknown unknowns all along; as we grasp for them, we formulate them, and thus we create their manifestation.</p>

<li>for example, when someone assumes that I cannot do something, when all the evidence they have is that I have not done that thing so far</li>
<li>or when someone does not try to look beyond their initial impression of somebody or something</li>
<li>is this narrowing of their potential world a protective mechanism, an adaptive response to past trauma? simply what they have been asked to believe in? a misunderstanding of the possibilities of reality?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>strongly suspect this is the same mechanism that allows people who behave abusively (all of us, some of the time) to believe that we behave responsibly all the time</li>
</ul>

<li>there is so much that is beyond a single person’s knowledge, beyond even our collective knowledge, it is something we don’t often stop to think about. what are the consequences of this, that actually is so dominant and effects our lives so deeply, even though we may never understand it?</li>

<ul>
<li>availability heuristic, related to overestimating the importance of what we can see or know rather than what we do not know or what we cannot know.</li>

<ul>
<li>we might think that all it takes to learn something is the right words, the right concepts, but reality is very different from that. we see and hear the words, we perceive the concepts, only in a partial fashion. it is what we do with the partial understanding that is magical — we transform it in a real, imperfectly practical process that becomes the fabric of our lives.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00297</h2>
<ul>
<li>the reality is that most people cannot hear what you are saying, even when they want to. this is not because of some failing, but because the processes of communication, recall, thinking and doing are all patchy, they rely on many factors which are often not available. but that doesn't mean we stop trying, it just means we must make do with what we have. there is need for better processes, but at root we recreate the reality that we make from incomplete means, even though we often do not understand that we do so.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00197</h2>
<ul>
<li>human knowledge is essentially wrong. this is not because of some great fraudulent conspiracy, but because it is the nature of knowledge to be incomplete. a map can never be the territory, that is not its nature.</li>
<li>from the daoist way that cannot be expressed to the socratic admonition to question what we think we know, to the buddhist world of illusory belief, to the stoic bounded locus of control, to genesis' forbidden tree; theories that show the limits of our abilities, in the service of living practical lives understanding that what we do understand is not all there is to the world.</li>
</ul>
<h2>the things and processes we do not understand are exactly the ones that end up affecting us the most, because we do nothing about them. it is not that we cannot do anything about them — we can, even if we do not know about them. i will try to explain the processes of diversification and prudence in the latter part of this book.</h2>
<ul>
<li>in any situation, what is missing will (eventually) become most critical, as the fact that we are missing it means it can have a greater negative effect before we come to deal with it.</li>
