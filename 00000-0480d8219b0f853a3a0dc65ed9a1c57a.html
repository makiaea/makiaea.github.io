<ul>
<li>DIP design in process / design <em>in</em> progress
<ul>
<li>re–evaluate what we do as a process so that we move towards progress</li>
<li>makes us more “relentless” and more “ruthless” — literally we relent less and regret less what we do, which initially might seem odd, but if you think about it a bit, it starts to make sense.</li>
<li>for example, if we <em>do</em> what we need to do, instead of not doing it, then it is easier to keep it up and later we cannot spend time regretting it. or if we always tell the truth, instead of lying and using the energy to maintain a separate version of reality, we can put our energy towards making our world a better place.</li>
<li>this process means that incrementally, little by little, each action we take contributes towards progress and steadily, surely, we become better than we were, better than the abusers as they cannot do the same.</li>
<li>three inter–related parts — book, mirror, sword. learn what we need, re–evaluate what we do, do it.</li>
<li>it is like a sail — instead of having to rely on the wind coming from behind us, as the abusers do, we can use the winds that blow in other directions — by deflecting them with our sails we can gain energy to move in the direction we choose — we are no longer only buffeted by the winds of fate, we can turn their momentum towards progress.</li>
<li>we can still sometimes lose our way, the winds can still sometimes blow us off course, but by using this process, as only we can, we will be blown <em>less</em> off course and <em>more rarely</em> than abusive people are.</li>
<li>the real world is not like an engine which we can feed and direct at our whim, it is like the wind and the sun — fates blowing in many directions and steadily, surely moving us each day. when we use the energy of the wind and the sun, as they can be used, then we move in ways the abusers cannot even hope to.</li>
<li>words–in–table version of above has “progress inexorable” on the left of the text in bold.</li>
<li>fossil fuels, abusers and their engines, are the same kind of lie. they move only by the abuse of others.</li>
<li>fossil fuel : lies

<li>nuclear is a fossil fuel</li>

<li>dear reader
<ul>
<li>
<p>the world is full of people who think they know better than you. i am not that kind of person. i wrote this book for myself, so it wasn't intended for others — you must write your own book for yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no matter who gave or recommended this book to you, read it only when you feel ready, ready to change your world. perhaps you already understand that we can never truly be ready, only as ready as we can be — then read on, dear friend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we meet here now, it may also be when we bring forth something wonderful from within.<br />
Let’s reach our potential, and dissolve the boundaries that once bound us.<br />
Here and now, let’s celebrate our journey, together.</p>
<ul>
<li>I set off on a journey to dissolve and reform my self. I know not where or how far, but this time I hope to share it with you.</li>
<li>The very time when we feel deeply lost — is it strange that is the time when the path opens for our journey?</li>
<li>When the spells, the armour, the shields gathered around us loosen — maybe then we can yield, change, transform.</li>
<li>A lucidly clear period begins, when I cherish each part of my self and choose to reabsorb, grow, or keep.</li>
<li>It can be a time of danger, if you cast away your anchors before preparing to sail, you may cast yourself adrift.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>a lot of things have to be just so for you to turn out the way you did. you had to learn to read well, to learn the knowledge of others, and also not be addicted to other's words so that you can think yourself. you had to learn early, so that you were not as bound by the chains of society that you could not escape their consequences. you had to learn to do, so that you could create your own life and not be so buffeted by the winds of random fate. you had to learn to cherish, so you could find and share life with others like you, and light paths for others to come.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for those who still take aeroplanes, here is a little story. one day you are about to go to the airport to catch a plane. somehow you know if you don't get that flight something terrible, awful, is going to happen. and for some reason, all the phones and internet are broken, you can't get through to anyone to warn them. but you're not old enough to drive and your parents won't let you cycle because it's too dangerous — and it's almost time for the flight and they don't even know how to get to the airport but they are sitting on their assets in the living room watching television. finally, through it is well past your departure time, you manage to chivvy them into the car, but they say they can't drop you there, it's too far and too much trouble. maybe the flight is delayed, maybe, just maybe catching a later flight will be ok and you can still avert the disaster. so now they drop you as far as they will go, you have to walk from miles away, with your luggage. so you abandon it and start running. your friend who can cycle helps you find the way. the kind staff at the airport radio ahead when you get there to ask them to hold the plane. but now you are in the clear tunnels leading to the plane but they twist and turn and have no exits except the ones labelled with numbers and none of them are yours and you run and run up the stairs and you can see the plane but not the way there. that is where we are right now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>read this book and you won't receive some kind of reward. i write not to make you believe or do something. i write to share my journey with you, my friends. and in so doing, help us do the things we want to do already. we do together what no one can do alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>connect us</p>
<ul>
<li>true can help protect us but perhaps more important is connecting us to other responsible people who we love and want to make a world with.</li>
<li>let's make it possible for more people to be like us. this is why we appreciate the best authors because they know our pain as well as our joy.</li>
<li>believe in yourself. there are things which are meant for you to do.</li>
<li>saving the world is a collective effort of all people, not something a dictator can do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>world as will be</p>
<ul>
<li>if your goal is to fit in the world as it is, then you may find this book a little useful. if your goal is to fit in the world as it will be, then you may find this book very useful.</li>
<li>this book is to help people who wish to plan for the future. we know there are some who deny not only their own problems and the problems they cause but also the problems of society and the world.</li>
<li>we are those who wish to behave responsibly, who will act to make this world a better place now and for the ones who come after us. by our efforts today, when the time comes there will be many of us ready and prepared to meet the challenges of the future.</li>
<li>we are going to change the world. people like us were rare but in a few short years will be the majority. how is this possible? it is because the majority already exists, we just haven't realised it yet.</li>
<li>perceived scarcity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>best of all to spend time with friends working together on projects. to our friends past, present and future, we love you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite many hardships, we believe we can make the world better. We know dealing with abuse is challenging, but we also know that we can do it. If you feel the same, then this is a book for you.<br />
When breaking away from a cycle of abuse, it can help to aim for a goal, a vision of what we strive for, to raise our spirits in times of need. Our wish is for all in the world to live a fulfilling life.<br />
Ah, but what is a fulfilling life, and how to live one despite all obstacles? That is what we aim to explain, by answering three questions.<br />
Firstly, how or what do we need to learn?<br />
Secondly, how or what do we need to think?<br />
Thirdly, how or what to we need to act?<br />
These three questions and answers are what we aim to show in The book, the mirror, and the sword.<br />
The aim of this book is a spell to draw forth your power to remake human society. It doesn't matter if it does or not. It's a spell but don't worry if you don't believe in spells, it will still work. It might be read by millions of people, it might not. It will still work.<br />
At first this book may seem unusual for our times, but in fact it is not unusual at all; it is just that society had not changed enough yet, changed enough to realise and remember what we had forgotten. This book is part of that change, a change back towards a better human nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has come to my attention that (through no fault of my own), I may not be around in a year's time. This is the legacy I write for my friends whom I love dearly. For the billions of friends I would have loved to live to meet, this is for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the future it could be a useful history book for small children, about what living in this time was like.</li>
<li>I wish I had more time to be with you and share our lives together, but we can make the most of what we have. That is the spirit in which I wrote this.</li>
<li>Perhaps the only major thing that I won't write about is my friends. While I don't mind people writing about me, this was an unusual viewpoint at this time, so I respect my friends' non–—public life by not writing about them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current textbooks are too absorbed by authority and repetition. We assume you can grasp a concept immediately, or else know to ponder over something and come back at it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are reading this of your own free will. We dislike people who try to manipulate others by inducing feelings of guilt. We are not going to be doing that. We believe people of ability will want to make the world a better place. This is a book to help you, if you are such a person. It wasn't written to convince anyone of anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have only a short message from Aya and myself to say today, so I hope you will hear us, and if not now, someday. Aya sends her love and we greet you today, our friends. We send you our warmest wishes and thank you for all the kind wishes you send us, and our apologies that we have not more time to write you as we are writing the next book, which we hope you will receive warmly too. Lots of love and kisses from me and Aya. (kiss) Have a great night everyone, thanks for listening!</p>

<li>book structure?
<ul>
<li>there is literally no end to the things you can say. so i choose only to say what i must.</li>
<li>headers as questions</li>
<li>paragraphs quoted in italics at beginning of chapter</li>
<li>You may read this book by following the pages serendipitously; some of the connections will be more salient to you at a certain time and you may wish to follow those. Or you can examine the table of contents where each chapter is summarised with a short description. If you use a computerised reader to read this book, you can also create your own connections, by using the search function to select certain words, and then choosing from the list of matching results in context to see where serendipity leads you. You can dip randomly into the book, or use bookmarks to mark your passage.</li>
<li>If you want to get started on everyday improvements then you might want to read part 3 first. If you enjoy thinking abstractly, and you already have a lot of background in responsibility you might want to read part 2 first, or even &quot;somesuch&quot;. If you are an old–school reader and like to build up a stucture progressing to logical conclusions you will want to read straight from beginning to end.</li>
<li>table of contents
<ul>
<li>Paragraph after each title to show why you would want to read that chapter, at what stage you want this knowledge. e.g. if want to keep documents in longterm access, and know prerequisite of programming, can compile pandoc. But this is all about self–trust in own ability.</li>
<li>e.g. This is an efficient way of running. It may not be the absolute most efficient but it is very efficient. Swimming same. Can apply two principles to swimming and walking, firstly follow physics, and secondly least effort. So lengthen body in water, and leaning forward; and least effort stroke and step.</li>
<li>write list of topics. like persistence, perfection.</li>

<ul>
<li>don’t have life energy to waste on doing make–work</li>
<li>to work towards a better world, need to understand what actions would lead toward that outcome as well as learn how to do them, and then actually do so.</li>
<li>not a lot of friends understand what i am doing, so i have to manage on less support than would be ideal, but that comes with the nature of what we are trying to achieve. the higher we aim, the further each person needs to climb before they can get there, so at the start there will be fewer friends around.</li>

<ul>
<li>about this book
<ul>
<li>
<p>emotion and logic, science and religion, thinking and doing — some people revere them. they are not the only ways to describe or live in the world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it might seem paradoxical or ironic, that the people least suited to wielding power responsibly are those that seek it. that those who seek enlightenment, happiness, or love shall not find it. for life is a journey, not a destination</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you need to read this, then once again the world is drowned in hatred. hate is such a simple, easy message — “hate them, for they are the cause of your suffering”. the abusers want you to believe only that hate is easy, that love — love is impossible.</p>
<p>yet love, too, is simple. together, let us remember how.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one sentence version: change is interesting, discuss. or “a positive version of jared diamond’s ‘collapse’, with why and how–not instead of how.”</p>
<ul>
<li>filtering the world through a lens of change/binding — change being the non–exclusive flipside of binding —what “makes” people abuse others? why do we interact the way we do?
<ul>
<li>so binding here in the sense both of bond and of addiction. how it enables abusive and destructive behaviour, on the worse side, and creative and civilising behaviour, on the better side. how it forms and decays with cognitive growth and decline. mental and societal models of process plus sundry speculations on this factor in the flourishing, decline, and fall of civilisations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>at its heart this book is about how to reject abuse and oppression, about how to cherish and love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a knack of change and momentum, of comprehending just what it is that is holding someone or something from their potential. In the world as I write, the most awful is human abuse and irresponsibility. Nobody is completely responsible, everyone is abusive in some way. But what I call abusers are far, far beyond this. How is it that abusers exist, perpetuate, abuse — and how do we do better?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the idea of reaching for our higher potential, what holds us back, and how to transcend it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>unusual in that want not only to do most actions unconsciously but also to periodically consciously review those unconscious habits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>want to write a book for people like me, who can fit in anywhere and adapt to any situation but also carry their examined values with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we tend to want to believe about the world what we believe in ourselves. i believe all people can do extraordinary things, so i don't believe i am particularly extraordinary. a cynical person, on the other hand, sees the reflection of himself in the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>unlike some people’s opinions of their own prowess, I believe most of what I am able to do is from chance circumstance that enabled the development of abilities that are inherent in all of us.</li>
<li>from the available evidence of my close genetic relatives I appear to have a partly genetic propensity to strong self–will. but here’s the odd–sounding thing. I also believe that almost everyone is strong–willed. it’s just that our strong wills are not always, or possibly even rarely, aligned with the best interests of the earth, humankind, or even our supposed individual values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>why is world the way it is, what can we do about it, and how do we go about doing it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>interesting questions and why we need to ask them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>am not only trying to do best I can with what I have — what some call “perfectionism” but also to learn how to do better, to question how I already do things, and to go ahead and do things, even though we don't and will never know the optimal solution</p>

<li>particular talent in empathising with people, communicating deeply. so why haven’t used this in twenty years? because chance discovery of idea of diversity–as–flourishing; by using communication talent, would be deeply influencing them with powerful ideas, which may well replace their not–yet–as–powerful ones, reducing diversity and the benefit to co–adapted systems. would rather people developed at own pace. also was testing the ideas, to see how they worked in the real world. but now, is different. ideas already zeitgeist, and needed to counteract sustained abuse.</li>

<li>I study the mental toolbox that we all use to build our lives, the mental tools for civilisation</li>
<li>am particularly interested in those kinds of things that people find it hard to know, that because of our situation and circumstances, are difficult for us to understand.</li>
<li>what to do, when you don't know what to do: the clearest answer can be seen in how healthy children approach the world</li>
<li>when there is too much to really understand, we try to digest some simple representative rule to help us, nevertheless, to decide what to do</li>
<li>some say that this is <em>always</em> the case, that there is in reality <em>always</em> too much to really understand, and thus that we <em>always</em> are approaching life in this manner — whether we understand that we do this, or not</li>
<li>the issues of learning, reflecting, and doing, are all issues of this same root — as it is not possible to have full knowledge, full understanding, or full capability, what is it that we <em>can</em> know, <em>aim</em> to understand, <em>choose</em> to do?</li>
<li>a really worthwhile problem, by definition, would be one that few currently understand — so in tackling it, we can help us better understand. but this does lead to difficulties in describing your work to others, since it is not yet widely understood</li>

<li>I work on dispelling delusions. delusions are protective illusions that insulate us from harsh reality. a bit like suncream to block the sun. but you have to reapply suncream often, and, like delusions, it is surprisingly destructive. far better to make tools like hats and shirts. the tool I am working on currently is evolution, specifically evolutionary diversity. the corresponding destructive delusion is evolutionary competition.</li>

<li>by any objective measure, doing these things is not going to save you time or energy or resources, except, possibly, in the very long term. so it’s a fair question to ask, why do them? the answer, as far as it goes, is that you should not do them. rather, these are some of the things which i did which may have helped me grow as a person, and there might be something similar that may help you grow — but they will likely be <em>different</em> things.</li>
<li>we change the world not through force or reason, but because people want to live like us. it is not an ideal life, it is not a perfect life, but it is a <em>thriving</em> life.</li>
<li>we’ll be refuting the idea of words, language, value, reason, hierarchy, institutions, power, control, science, faith, belief, desire, certainty, evolution (don’t worry, evolution works, just not the way we thought it does); pretty much every major assumption of society…</li>

<p>i don’t know how to solve this, i just got back here myself. you must have had a hard journey too.</p>

<p>i may not be able to go much further, but let’s set out on this new journey together xx</p>

<li>In the world in which I write, it has been a matter of luck whether you are ready to understand what I write to you about. Who knows, it may still be that way in the future — but there is a strong chance that it will be different, simply because you are reading this book, or learning something similar.</li>
<li>Understanding the role of luck and chance in our lives removes the most damaging illusions that stand in the way of our civilisation’s continued existence, and clears a path towards a harmonious relationship with our planet.</li>

<p>could it be that i am drawn to areas because they are the most lacking in our current culture? things like empathy and understanding of randomness, but also understanding of how our words do not mean what we might believe we mean, things like time or solitude or love, agency or memory or meaning.</p>
<p>it is not that everything is an illusion, but that much of the current culture is an illusion -- so much so that trying to describe living without those illusions is difficult, even if the living itself is not so difficult. it might be that in your era or culture, you are lucky not to have this issue, but it was present here and that might be why the words i write sound strange to you as they mean different things in your time.</p>

<p>people don't want to hear something if it contradicts their beliefs, but why is this so?</p>
<p>there is no getting around the fact that anything that challenges their illusion of reality will be seen as a threat; that is part of the way threat is defined. so when friends reject what you know, because they feel it as a threat, don't take it as them rejecting you (even though it is); rather, they do not yet see a difference between what you know and who you are, so they are not rejecting you intentionally.</p>
<p>most people assume that who you are, how you behave, depends on what you know. to begin with, this might seem true, but as you learn beyond this assumption, you will find that what you know no longer determines who you are.</p>
<p>or maybe there are other &quot;rules&quot; that could describe how what we know shows who we are, but they are not the simple rules people mostly rely on; i don't know what those other rules are.</p>
<p>ordinarily i don't seem to think much about who i am. but i do register it when people reject me for what they think i am. maybe i don't think about it much because i no longer find it as useful a concept as i used to (i probably did find it useful for some time).</p>
