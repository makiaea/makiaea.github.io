<li>cries of banzai spread through the playground</li>

</li>
<li>scene of being on the bus gives sense of scale of campus
<ul>
<li>but more notable in journey is seeing the deprivation</li>
<li>people sleeping rough on top of busshelters even at risk of rape</li>
<li>nostalgia at seeing drummer cult group with their guru and shelter spanning large area on top of some shelter but still on the one level</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>scene of dancing in unison through the obstacles is quite fun
<ul>
<li>organically evolve the dance through matching and changing the movement of the person on front, there are multiple branches but all originate from same source so has continuity</li>
<li>are these the music students or are they empathy students</li>
<li>helical movement of dance reminds me of DNA but maybe i shouldn't spell out, just show it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>scene of being very late for dinner with friends who have young
<ul>
<li>they are falling asleep at the table when we arrive</li>
<li>can hear the crying baby and get up to go meet it</li>
<li>the parents lag behind</li>
<li>then more children emerge</li>
<li>this may be where dream segues into the one with the students being studied</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>big cards handed out by professors saying recipients are now part of the study
<ul>
<li>relief of two friends after avoiding being selected turns to horror when all study participants take a partner on signal</li>
<li>is the study the prelude to the grinder?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>study card seems to say that you are now a music student? but actually says you are a transfer student and must pick a random partner as a long term mentor
<ul>
<li>could the study be about power relations between mentors and mentees?</li>
<li>could it be how they select partners?</li>
<li>could it be how closely students conform to instruction and authority?</li>
<li>is this the point of the book, that the great experimenter, God, is trying to see what we make of our lives together?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>see friends saved from oven exhibit but then he is ground up by the hamburger exhibit
<ul>
<li>all the students are watching in unison and they start crying</li>
<li>puking students are making mess in all the bathrooms which is not cleaned up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>one toilet is through a narrow crawlspace and you can see that students haven't made it through before starting to puke
<ul>
<li>but it's not the puking or the crying that is being studied</li>
<li>is it the mess and the subsequent plague and deaths?</li>
<li>some of the next trials could include starvation and lack of shelter</li>
<li>but it's actually the second years' revolt that is being tested</li>
<li>or is it? how many years does this go up?</li>

<li>plot synopsis
<ul>
<li>conspiracy, how far does it go?</li>
<li>willing to sacrifice an entire area like fukushima</li>
<li>say it is a destabilising attack by outside forces when actually cover up for internal faction war</li>
<li>effective agent: biological agent (zombie virus) covered up by radiation covered up by nano machine</li>
<li>twist at the end of story is that friend on ultra radio in agency that helps me escape is actually rogue ai. gets cut off admitting this (how do you think i survived, she says) by nuclear emp blast. main character goes on regardless because hasn't made connection yet but reader knows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>tension device
<ul>
<li>agent plants device but escape plan goes wrong and is forced to escape on foot, hearing leading edge of zombie plague. when inside buildings or other quiet points can keep tension by internal dialogue speculation about how to get out, who the perpetrator is, what they want, whether this has been done before, and radio friend provides updates on spread and tips on how to escape</li>
<li>tips like go into positive pressure building, cut way out of fabric on appropriate side, how to get past reception by saying partner left her phone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>characters
<ul>
<li>am agent to plant device, am supposed to be sacrificed, but cotton on that something is going on</li>
<li>narrative help from friend in agency (who turns out to be rogue ai)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>plot outline
<ul>
<li>set up in station, choose uniformed guard because they will still be marginally accepted because of uniform even though they begin acting strangely</li>
<li>don't know what the active agent in device is but take reasonable precaution like heading upwind</li>
<li>want to hijack or take bicycle to escape but get caught by local mafia who object to stealing on their turf. bicycle would be good to reach escape motorbike but have to go on foot</li>
<li>they corner me in a dead end with three lifts, debate pull out gun and go in one. debate shooting fat arm who is holding door open from out side but realise afterwards that there is probably cameras and they would stop the lift, which is not what i want. anyway there are no controls in the lift... but we hear screams and the hand withdraws in time to cut the screams off...</li>
<li>in casino complex, need to find way out to surface. cut off from radio by being underground. high arched entrance way for super vip guests reaches all way to surface. can see the sunlight in far corner of huge room</li>
<li>make way to surface, reestablish contact</li>
<li>advised to stay indoors as outdoors has spread very far very quickly. go to positive pressure structure that houses wedding photos area, risk cutting way out uphill to park (wind direction up or down hill? investigate)</li>
<li>that's as far as the dream got</li>

<ul>
<li>immersion operatives
<ul>
<li>
<p>why immerse? shows peanut butter jar flipping from smooth to crunchy and back</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>revert to child shape when enemy which entered at the same time as you is gone. control keyboard emerging from around eyes and mouth — horrifying when first seen</p>
<ul>
<li>before this had scene where uncle of hero was inducting hero into immersion — without the whole keyboard thing being necessary for hero, it seems. the sim has hero crawling through farm, knocking away barriers made of sausages. the hero is followed by little real chicks that peck away only at the moved sausages — indicates rural world intrusion due to poor technique? not explained. uncle is counting the elapsed time and this counting still occurs when hero steps out of bounds by setting foot outside farm gates — we know that that represents coming back to reality briefly</li>
<li>miniature farm laid out on ground with farm buildings but hero is normal sized to us and so are the chicks and sausages, which means they are all giant sized in relation to the farm model</li>
<li>the sausages seem to bar entrance to certain sections of the farm but the hero moves the linked chains of sausages aside easily, whereupon the chicks seem to be able to detect the sausages and start pecking at them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is key as in first scene we see the submergence into several levels of reality and it is very confusing to watch as the enemy and team seem to dive in mid air into shimmering water surfaces and dissolve away at the surface but then re emerge in the same room (for scene filming sake)</p>
<p>it is only when the hero pops into boy form that we know the enemy is dead — if only one person is left from the particular joint immersion they somehow appear as a child version of themselves — everyone is relieved, even though this means that the other team member who went in has died too — this is the only sure way of knowing the enemy has been killed / has gone as otherwise too confusing to keep track of multiple immersions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>television interview with operator shows blurred out lower face and we know the blur is because of the horrific keyboard and we assume the slurred speech is also the result of the keys jammed in the mouth — but then she learns forward and strokes and talks to chameleon on the table in front of her, and she has a normal mouth — what is going on? is she somehow different?</p>
<ul>
<li>more important, does this mean she is like the hero in not needing a keyboard? they meet and fall in love (not shown)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>rogues gallery of the evil abusive people the toad members used to be before they joined up — one was a manager</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>enemy forcibly sends in manual of sushi as the hero takes heroine on a date in time 113</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>earlier they we swimming along underwater and the reach the room where he starts putting objects onto the table that represent parts of himself — the manual of sushi is appearing page by page through the letterbox in the door, with a jarring thud as each page appears to attach itself to the book, but the hero and heroine are so into each other that they do not notice, even as the book starts to crowd out our field of vision onto the table and the objects start to move right along the table and fall off (the letter hole is in the door to the left which butts onto the left side of the table and we focus on it as soon as we hear the first thud but we also hear the hero and heroine talking on between themselves with no care in the world as they clearly have not seen the intrusion — and we are also unclear what this enemy intrusion means (it is unexplained)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>two other operatives shown as terminated on screen — and message pops up that here is also in same vicinity in 113 — has he gone rogue? retrieval team sent me find out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one operative somehow goes in but in miniature form — or are all the others expanding into giants in this immersion but she somehow isn't? why this would we is unexplained but mysterious. the others manifest with scuba style jet sleds and the last one before her gives her a ride (she grasps onto sled rod as he sweeps past)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is where I woke up, with the operatives disappearing off screen bottom as the swept away towards the hero and heroine</p>

<li>singing computer
<ul>
<li>wouldn't it be cool if we could sing to the computer and it could understand us? imagine, you could sing different stanzas which had the same tune and it would know they refer to the same thing. the songs for each group of related things could be from a related series or band or composer. it might be relatively easy to implement too, all you would need is an interface to applescript, which helps you give commands to the existing computer system, a method to recognise pitch and duration, a system to record this and match up previous data. the pitch recognition we already see in guitar tuning applications. the record system could possibly be very simple if all we need to keep is relative pitch between notes, rather than the notes themselves. in that case each phrase would need to consist of at least two notes. which might be easier for different users than to require perfect pitch to match exactly what was recorded, at the correct frequency.</li>
<li>there's no need for complex machinery to recognise different syllables, but there is need to understand the transitions between notes.</li>
<li>maybe in answer the computer could sing in harmony for a little or a duet or even just instrumental! imagine a character opening a door this way.</li>
<li>in a story where the character abandons his computer for a real person, the final scene could be of the computer starting up again after the new pair have left, and singing the rest of the harmony that the other person usurped — how tragic!</li>
<li>&quot;you shall be trapped here on earth as a spirit, until you find true love.&quot; but the true love that she finds isn't actually for herself and the boy, but that between the boy and his new friend. once they leave together, she is free, but in a tragic way.</li>

<li>the new hero’s journey
<ul>
<li>aim: to update the hero’s journey for responsible people</li>
<li>abstract: the hero’s journey was good enough for 1990’s america but not good enough for the responsible world society we wish to build. to help responsible people on their way to story–making, we want to update the hero’s journey so that it is easier for responsible people to make responsible stories and to create a culture of responsibility from a world perspective.</li>
<li>how to go about this: we will copy parts of the hero’s journey and adapt them to the ways which we want to show. we will draw from the best manga, anime films and tv series as well as the eastern and western books and films we admire such as spirited away, stellvia, mujin wakusei survive, nausicaä (manga), ikiru, district 9, star trek, groundhog day, top wo nerae, friday, citizen of the galaxy, stranger in a strange land.</li>
<li>we will also concentrate on matters not touched upon in the original hero’s journey, such as pacing (star trek and district 9), environment (mujin wakusei survive, nausicaä, future boy conan), compact styles (top wo nerae). we will be using proper story style (as portrayed in women who run with wolves) rather than the disney–american circular story style which is perpetuated by books such as the original hero’s journey.</li>

<p>SALIGIA based on the first letters in Latin of the seven deadly sins: superbia, avaritia, luxuria, invidia, gula, ira, acedia.</p>
<p>as wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The modern concept of the seven deadly sins is linked to the works of the 4th century monk Evagrius Ponticus, who listed eight evil thoughts in Greek as follows:[6]</p>
<p>Γαστριμαργία (gastrimargia) gluttony<br />
Πορνεία (porneia) prostitution, fornication<br />
Φιλαργυρία (philargyria) avarice<br />
Ὑπερηφανία (hyperēphania) hubris – sometimes rendered as self-esteem[7]<br />
Λύπη (lypē) sadness – in the Philokalia, this term is rendered as envy, sadness at another's good fortune<br />
Ὀργή (orgē) wrath<br />
Κενοδοξία (kenodoxia) boasting<br />
Ἀκηδία (akēdia) acedia – in the Philokalia, this term is rendered as dejection<br />
They were translated into the Latin of Western Christianity (largely due to the writings of John Cassian),[8] thus becoming part of the Western tradition's spiritual pietas (or Catholic devotions), as follows:[9]</p>
<p>Gula (gluttony)<br />
Fornicatio (fornication, lust)<br />
Avaritia (avarice/greed)<br />
Superbia (hubris, pride)<br />
Tristitia (sorrow/despair/despondency)<br />
Ira (wrath)<br />
Vanagloria (vainglory)<br />
Acedia (sloth)<br />
These &quot;evil thoughts&quot; can be categorized into three types:[9]</p>
<p>lustful appetite (gluttony, fornication, and avarice)<br />
irascibility (wrath)<br />
intellect (vainglory, sorrow, pride, and Discouragement)<br />
In AD 590, a little over two centuries after Evagrius wrote his list, Pope Gregory I revised this list to form the more common Seven Deadly Sins, by folding (sorrow/despair/despondency) into acedia, vainglory into pride, and adding envy.[10] In the order used by Pope Gregory, and repeated by Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) centuries later in his epic poem The Divine Comedy, the seven deadly sins are as follows:</p>
<p>luxuria (lechery/lust)[11][12][13]<br />
gula (gluttony)<br />
avaritia (avarice/greed)<br />
acedia (sloth/discouragement)<br />
ira (wrath)<br />
invidia (envy)<br />
superbia (pride)<br />
The identification and definition of the seven deadly sins over their history has been a fluid process and the idea of what each of the seven actually encompasses has evolved over time. Additionally, as a result of semantic change:</p>
<p>socordia sloth was substituted for acedia<br />
It is this revised list that Dante uses. The process of semantic change has been aided by the fact that the personality traits are not collectively referred to, in either a cohesive or codified manner, by the Bible itself; other literary and ecclesiastical works were instead consulted, as sources from which definitions might be drawn.[citation needed] Part II of Dante's Divine Comedy, Purgatorio, has almost certainly been the best known source since the Renaissance.[citation needed]</p>
<p>The modern Catholic Catechism lists the sins in Latin as &quot;superbia, avaritia, invidia, ira, luxuria, gula, pigritia seu acedia&quot;, with an English translation of &quot;pride, avarice, envy, wrath, lust, gluttony, and sloth/acedia&quot;.[14] Each of the seven deadly sins now also has an opposite among corresponding seven holy virtues (sometimes also referred to as the contrary virtues). In parallel order to the sins they oppose, the seven holy virtues are humility, charity, kindness, patience, chastity, temperance, and diligence (see below).</p>

<li>I write at the end of an age when abusive humankind appropriated the energy of fossilised earth and accreted an industrial rapacious militarised civilisation upon the land.</li>
<li>In another age I might have herded goats and never known of the world beyond my tribe. But I live in this time, supported at first unknowingly by the lifeblood of countless others.</li>
<li>Yet although these facts set the scene, they are not the story we wish to tell. Our story begins in that age but ends in another. It is the story of a young man and a young woman who lived far apart across the seas and yet became dearest of friends. It is the story of how they and humankind came to realise that they had all already begun to change irrevocably and that this was why the age was ending and a new one beginning.</li>
<li>In the year some called 1976, a year of the dragon, were born a boy and a girl. One drew breath for the first time in a city they called London, on an island at the east of the ocean that grows wider. On that little island the signs were ominous. The greatest drought in living memory greeted the dragon year.</li>
<li>The other first gave voice on another island, many years journey away on an island on the west of the ring of fire.</li>
<li>(interlude)</li>
<li>People did not understand that predicting the future was not like some crystal ball that showed you what was going to happen at a specific instant. It is actually knowing the flows of potential and how they will move, not because you know exactly how they will move but because you know how they moved before. It's like knowing where a ball will land when you have just thrown it.</li>
<li>That's what he knew about the reactors. When the information the politicians spouted was almost fact-free, he could still draw the conclusions based on what he knew they could not say. The reactors would not only melt down and explode, it would be many times worse than that first explosion across the world, because here the earthquake had disrupted the non-resilient systems that humans had made. And yet he still wanted to go out there to help, because he knew also what the politicians could not say, the exclusion zones around the reactors were also death sentences to the trapped people who had survived the earthquakes but would now be left to die in the freezing winter.</li>
<li>Soon also the effects would show more obviously on the rest of the world. The consequences of the explosions not only disrupted the fragile fossil fuel infrastructures on the island, but also worldwide as people came to realise they were really in the same boat — any disruption to the non–resilient structures on which they depended spelled their end.</li>
<li>So it was time to speak of the skills he had learned, that others were still yet to learn — which he hoped they would soon learn.</li>
<li>Like the resilient bicycle to search for survivors. Solid rubber tyres where a non-resilient used air–filled — that could not be punctured by debris. Suspension in the frame for both wheels since the solid rubber could not absorb impacts as air –filled tyres could. Powered by muscles, replenished by food. Noisemaker with earmuffs so rider could make noise while muffed and then remove to better hear response from survivors.</li>
<li>Hell, he even spoke some of the language.</li>
<li>END</li>
<li>And though he was yet young, he knew there were not many years ahead for him and he resolved to see his sister one last time. After a journey of many adventures he came to the sea where she grew up and found she had passed on years before. After a period of deep sadness, he lived with joy the remainder of his years among her people, and at the end of his days they scattered his ashes to join her together always on the ocean of the dawn.</li>

<li>biggest bazaar in the galaxy
<ul>
<li><strong>biggest bazaar in the galaxy</strong> miles of continuous rectangular blocks of stores, the blocks just being defined by space rather than walls. stop at secondhand bookstore with several large paperback editions of a book with japanese on the cover and two words, 'witch heather'. picture of heather on inside page who is asian and wearing a jumpsuit, on one knee with raygun in hand ready but aiming upwards in air.</li>
<li>(have to explain to merchant in gestures that i want to flip through the book, but he mistakes my gesture at first to mean that i want to buy it straight away and reaches for the 'bags' which are like thin strings (which i know will expand to bags)). the fact that the merchant devotes so much space to identicalish items means that it would be famous somewhere (but i don't know why it is famous).</li>
<li>(this bazaar sequence drops the reader straight into the story) there is some suggestion that can pay with the currency of the homeland of the vendor, if you knew what that was, like hongkongdollarnotes of yore. (friend is 'faxed' a pile of these, they are in the hopper of the fax and he pays for stuff at a merchant with some; there is a sequence with him saying 'so why am i in jail when i did nothing wrong' (you see him being rude in many situations, 'well-deserving' of jailtime in this culture, such as helping himself to the cash register instead of waiting for the merchant to do it, because the merchant is busy with another customer -- it seems this sequence could encode some of the rules of the bazaar into an example that visitors will understand because it happens to their friend who does not understand why he is being punished). i do wonder why the bazaar is a one-level infinity instead of many but this may just be the metaphor i understand as we shop while walking in our culture from shop to shop, and this configuration enables that behaviour, a behavioural matching to each client? how do we navigate an infinite bazaar? seems like the entire left side is an exit, that ahead and far to the right are an infinite expanse of merchant stores, limit is our eye definition. we move to where we see things we like, towards right and merchants 'disappear' to our rear if they 'pass' the 'left line' which stays relative to us, not to them. this could be a useful navigation method for a filesystem in a computer, for example. the floor curves somewhat upwards so that we get a view over the tops of the stalls a little. each block stall could represent a 'folder' or 'system' and the individual items on shelves. this is a very compact way to represent way to access storage, in a very limited-scope visual-field display. we 'turn to the side' to look at the merchant's stall, and turn away back to navigation in the bazaar when we are finished. the bazaar is not heirarchical in the bazaar level as all shops are an individual project equal with other projects (is this the way i access information? i remember the name of a project rather than its relation to others) but within each stall there are items on various levels of shelves with those at eye level the most important. then within each item/book there is a sequence that is optional, like the arrangement of a dress or the leaves of a tome. so navigation level is non-heirarchical and simple to navigate, then stall level is semi-heirarchical with eye level used as filter, but many items on same level of shelf, then item level is semi-sequential, we can choose to follow the sequence or not, like pages in a book rather than a single scrolling document. the so-called research into different section of attention being activated for each 'room' with memories per-room rather than sequential, might actually be more a per-stall memory rather than per room. the metaphor of going through the doorway and forgetting what we went to the room to get, should rather be a metaphor of resetting expectations when we move to a new stall.</li>
<li><strong>extra carpet</strong> in an earlier sequence, was laying down extra carpet to help make a step under which the automatic carpet machine would raise it automatically into a ziggurat-type stair. (has to be carpet otherwise machine compensates for height?)</li>
<li>(gap) aid confused friend who is registering for something and leaves his tablet unattended on the table while he does so, shown him being pickpocketed and stolen from and his tablet taken while he talks -- a warning to shoppers to beware pickpockets?</li>
<li><strong>skydiving galaxy olympics</strong> am opening the package which contains a chest shield with some ribbons on it (which turns out to be a costume). teacher-friend comes in and announces when questioned that am about to join the skydiving olympics (galaxy olympics) -- when have never done it before in my life. he shows a few &quot;signature moves&quot; that one pulls while 'diving' (more like dancing it seems in the air) such as sonic hedgehog finger, strange kick that seems like extra leg comes under him to 'flip the bird', all sorts of other ones i don't yet remember.</li>
<li>so on way to registration for the skydiving competition, wearing coat with tassels like a bird of paradise tail that teacher friend swirls about.</li>
<li>one 'signature move' is a wizard of oz sketch, &quot;at your age greyhinda, your brother was like, 'beep. the wizard of oz is late' (mimes action of electronic watch beeping on hand and checking said watch), whereas later he was holding a tablet and trying to write with it like a pen (and failing miserably as holding tablet computer with both hands and trying to use it like a pen is strange) and writing (while narrating) 'and the wizard of oz was masterfully writing away'</li>
<li><strong>pointe to nutcracker in the wooden library</strong> segue to dancing ballet with pointe shoes into an amazing library, the rattles on my coat tassels clicking a little with each step.</li>
<li>dance up the stairs to the tune and rhythm of the nutcracker da da di da dum, da da di da dum, hanging in air if needed longer and quieter (ie. no pointe thumping on wooden stair or floor) when librarian stares. the library seems like an endless mass of shelves and stairs, even stranger than the bazaar.</li>

<li>panmuria
<ul>
<li>My dear readers, as our old adversary, lemuria (university of lemuria), will tell you, we at pangaea have a very distinguished history.</li>
<li>In the early twenty–first century there was a problem. Humans had outgrown their proper limits but did not know how to return to living within those proper limits. The very earth itself was changed and scarred by the abuse from humans. The extractive, irresponsible culture and system that abusive people built brought the earth to the brink of catastrophe.</li>
<li>For us to think back on those dark times, it might seem initially incongruous that the very generation of humans that were born and grew up then could become the happiest and most responsible then yet to arise. But without darkness there is no light, and that light shines brightly today: humankind rose to the challenge, and together we build our responsible society.</li>
<li>Much of this introductory material you will already know from your life and studies, so feel free to skim quickly through it; if you later come to understand you missed something, or want to explore something in depth, you can research the sections you need. This is a general introductory text for all students; each student will have or find different areas of knowledge they need or wish to learn about.</li>
<li>Some of you will be travelling long, from far–away lands before you reach pangaea, and I hope this text will be a good companion on that journey. Indeed some of you, on those very journeys, will settle in happiness instead in a land or in a sea which you never sought but to which you arrived nonetheless; that too is a goodness. The university of pangaea is not a paradise, it too is a place for people to live and learn and love, so in a sense we are together no matter where we are.</li>
<li>20101207university of pangaea</li>
<li>To learn those things that we as a society need to learn, it would be useful to have a structure that facilitated this. As we write today, the universities of the past are finding it difficult to sustain the task which faces them, the so–called education of the people.</li>
<li>What universities will remain is good meeting points for people, for people to interact and learn from each other face–to–face. Whereas some of the most advanced science uses expensive equipment, much of human endeavour does not require large monetary expense, only applied human effort and time.</li>
<li>What we aim for is the facilitation of some of those other learning functions, but in a sustainable and accessible manner.</li>
<li>So we will be recommending a course of study, which you will need to choose.  We will be covering as much of the entirety of human civilisation as we can, and are broad enough in our focus to cover not only those topics we think we need, but also those that we may not think we need but nonetheless actually do need.</li>

<li>black hole
<ul>
<li>imagine a black hole. according to current theory, the intense gravitation distorts space time such that there is a well of potential. this well is so deep and so steep that from most of the surface, light cannot escape from it, hence the name black hole. but even black holes are not completely black in reality. they interact with things outside of them and influence these to produce phenomena like jets of matter and radiation from the axis of rotation.</li>
<li>you can compare a person to a black hole. our own reality distorts the space time around us in ways such that reality is changed before it reaches us.</li>
<li>some people's black holes have become so permanent that nothing short of serious trauma will pierce the event horizon.</li>

<li>A Responsible Age
<ul>
<li>Imagine, in the season between the equinoxes, of gazing up at the sky on a clear night. Each year, on a few such pellucid evenings, we might, if we are lucky, see bright arcs streak across the sky as the perseid meteors fall to earth -- or some of them, at least. At such times as these, we may come to understand that our time on this earth is as fleeting as a shooting star, although on any other night it may seem as eternal as the stars which twinkle so mischievously.</li>
<li>Imagine, if you can, the world as it was, one such evening...</li>
<li>The ever-changing world is like a river, perhaps first seen as a tiny trickle pooling from high mountain rains, now a rushing current dashing through steep rocky valleys, then a slow laden flow winding over fertile plains. Some years, this river reaches a sea, where the fertile silty water langorously mingles with the wide ocean. On many a dry day, some rises as floating vapour with the heat of the sun, the wind gathers these clouds for pastures new, perhaps a far high meadow, where the cooling water falls once more as refreshing rain.</li>
<li>The history of the modern world began with the exploitation of coal and oil, those fossilised shards of ancient sun which fed a ravenous monster calling itself civilisation.</li>
<li>trends drawn from non–conscious understanding of data points which our conscious thoughts do not realise are connected -- similar to ''Friday'' by robert heinlein.</li>
<li>develop into story</li>
<li>luck favours well–prepared.</li>
<li>hunting: wind–direction, acting like predator by hunting at dusk; somewhere to store prey away from real predators — maybe a storage–shed somewhere?</li>
<li>survival test similar to alexei panshin's? abandoned on a planet.</li>
<li>always been sensitive, but able to use sensitivity to advantage rather than be overwhelmed by it.</li>
<li>these are main points of book: (e.g.) morality, what we are trying to show, luck,</li>
<li>thresholds and levels of ''diversity'', understanding trends and change, darwinism theory</li>
<li>ask about other types of scientific theory to show by story–form.</li>
<li>compile list of things we want to say; and then prepare scenes that show them.</li>
<li>writing scenes and piecing them together to form story ''is similar to'' readying tool before we need it and using it when appropriate — this is one aim: what is preparedness and how to do it even when we haven't been taught or are misled about life.</li>
<li>diversity of experience, culture and outlook as well as skills and just numbers as well (individuals vs. collective) — this is why diversity exists (survival–value)</li>
<li>inspiration and resting, doing other things until ready</li>
<li>write scenes depicting each quality and piece them together in hierarchical order — as we see many things not in order but ''understand'' them only from within a framework (though this is not necessarily a hierarchical framework).</li>

<li>just earlier you had been watching news of the find of the Phoenix by another team — but the other team was of your trainers… you didn't know another team existed. that is when your sis asks you abruptly to show her what you found, and you go together while the others watch at camp.</li>
<li>why? why did a tactical nuke explode on the camp? sis suspects foul play and asks you to trust her with your life — and to hold on to her hand and dive, for longer than you would have thought possible. this, she explains later, was to avoid the aircraft’s sensors.</li>

<li>entry to the vortex</li>
<li>the grey garbed ones ascend the zigzagging roots perhaps to the high cable car in the clouds but i lose my tree trunks in the wind and vertigo when i take a shortcut that turns out to be even more peril than ascending into the storm</li>
<li>where this is going</li>
<li>didn't expect it to be this hard from the start but it seems it is harbinger of time to come</li>
<li>supposed to be in there a week to learn new skills and teamwork but ends up being a lifetime</li>

<li>Not everyone is lucky enough to have a guide for the journey.</li>
<li>When we are too soft, we need someone to support us.</li>
<li>I wish I had had that support.</li>
<li>So now I write for myself.</li>

<li>understanding there are no absolute indicators</li>
<li>understanding relative importance</li>
<li>why people can be abusive</li>
<li>how to trust a person</li>
<li>how to be trustworthy</li>
<li>the likelihood of finding someone trustworthy</li>
<li>the likelihood of finding someone to love</li>
<li>the likelihood of finding any type of person</li>
<li>the likelihood of finding any type of situation</li>
<li>learning the tools to help find others (what other people find attractive is not necessarily the best way)</li>
