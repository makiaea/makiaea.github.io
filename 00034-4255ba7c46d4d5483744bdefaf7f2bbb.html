<p><em>the origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind</em><br />
julian jaynes 1976</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>interesting to me because (am halfway through) the forces at work in the bicameral mind seem to me to be still at work, just more subtly. autism, extremism, mental “illness”, and a reinvigoration of behaviour characteristic of the bicameral era could be our expressions of what we no longer, or cannot understand, or simply of what we do not control.</p>
<p>while i do not seem to have auditory hallucinations like he attributes to people of the bicameral era, the strong motivation to write, to understand, could be a different outlet for the same impulse.</p>

<p><em>scientific discovery in a model-centric framework: reproducibility, innovation, and epistemic diversity</em><br />
berna devezer et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216125">doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216125</a></p>

<p>Reproducible scientific results are not always true and true scientific results are not always reproducible, according to a mathematical model produced by University of Idaho researchers. Their study, which simulates the search for that scientific truth, will be published Wednesday, May 15, in the journal PLOS ONE.</p>
<p>Independent confirmation of scientific results -- known as reproducibility -- lends credibility to a researcher's conclusion. But researchers have found the results of many well-known science experiments cannot be reproduced, an issue referred to as a &quot;replication crisis.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Over the last decade, people have focused on trying to find remedies for the 'replication crisis,'&quot; said Berna Devezer, lead author of the study and U of I associate professor of marketing in the College of Business and Economics. &quot;But proposals for remedies are being accepted and implemented too fast without solid justifications to support them. We need a better theoretical understanding of how science operates before we can provide reliable remedies for the right problems. Our model is a framework for studying science.&quot;</p>
<p>Devezer and her colleagues investigated the relationship between reproducibility and the discovery of scientific truths by building a mathematical model that represents a scientific community working toward finding a scientific truth. In each simulation, the scientists are asked to identify the shape of a specific polygon.</p>
<p>The modeled scientific community included multiple scientist types, each with a different research strategy, such as performing highly innovative experiments or simple replication experiments. Devezer and her colleagues studied whether factors like the makeup of the community, the complexity of the polygon and the rate of reproducibility influenced how fast the community settled on the true polygon shape as the scientific consensus and the persistence of the true polygon shape as the scientific consensus.</p>
<p>Within the model, the rate of reproducibility did not always correlate with the probability of identifying the truth, how fast the community identified the truth and whether the community stuck with the truth once they identified it. These findings indicate reproducible results are not synonymous with finding the truth, Devezer said.</p>
<p>Compared to other research strategies, highly innovative research tactics resulted in a quicker discovery of the truth. According to the study, a diversity of research strategies protected against ineffective research approaches and optimized desirable aspects of the scientific process.</p>
<p>Variables including the makeup of the community and complexity of the true polygon influenced the speed scientists discovered the truth and persistence of that truth, suggesting the validity of scientific results should not be automatically blamed on questionable research practices or problematic incentives, Devezer said. Both have been pointed to as drivers of the &quot;replication crisis.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We found that, within the model, some research strategies that lead to reproducible results could actually slow down the scientific process, meaning reproducibility may not always be the best -- or at least the only -- indicator of good science,&quot; said Erkan Buzbas, U of I assistant professor in the College of Science, Department of Statistical Science and a co-author on the paper. &quot;Insisting on reproducibility as the only criterion might have undesirable consequences for scientific progress.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Consistent confirmations obtained independently of each other lend credibility to a scientific result. We refer to results satisfying this consistency as reproducible and assume that reproducibility is a desirable property of scientific discovery. Yet seemingly science also progresses despite irreproducible results, indicating that the relationship between reproducibility and other desirable properties of scientific discovery is not well understood. These properties include early discovery of truth, persistence on truth once it is discovered, and time spent on truth in a long-term scientific inquiry. We build a mathematical model of scientific discovery that presents a viable framework to study its desirable properties including reproducibility. In this framework, we assume that scientists adopt a model-centric approach to discover the true model generating data in a stochastic process of scientific discovery. We analyze the properties of this process using Markov chain theory, Monte Carlo methods, and agent-based modeling. We show that the scientific process may not converge to truth even if scientific results are reproducible and that irreproducible results do not necessarily imply untrue results. The proportion of different research strategies represented in the scientific population, scientists’ choice of methodology, the complexity of truth, and the strength of signal contribute to this counter-intuitive finding. Important insights include that innovative research speeds up the discovery of scientific truth by facilitating the exploration of model space and epistemic diversity optimizes across desirable properties of scientific discovery.</p>

<li>“it is wrong to think of industrial civilization as a road leading toward the development of man”</li>
<li>“<em>shirky principle</em>: institutions exist to preserve the problem to which they have a solution”</li>
<li>“traditional cultures can be conceived as meaningful configurations that have as their principal purpose the repression of those conditions under which scarcity could become dominant in social relations”</li>
<li>that which can be taught is not the way</li>
<li>“the concept that the clergy can define its own services as needs of human nature and make this service commodity into a necessity that cannot be foregone by any single human being without jeopardy to eternal life.”</li>
<li>“Lewis Mumford tried to make this point. When I first read his statement that the monastic reform of the ninth century created some of the basic assumptions on which the industrial system is founded, I had many reasons to reject this insight. In the meantime, though, I found a host of arguments — most of which Mumford seems not even to suspect — for rooting the ideologies of the industrial age in the Carolingian Renaissance. The idea that there is no salvation without <em>personal services</em> from the institutional church is one of these formerly unthinkable discoveries without which, again, our own age would be unthinkable.”</li>
<li>“Plato, one of the few giants who struggles with the divide between orality and literacy, makes this transition from ever newly recalled experience to literate memory the subject of his Phaedrus. He was acutely aware that with the teacher who sows (written) words, which can neither speak for themselves nor teach the truth adequately to others (Phaedr. 276a), an entirely new epoch was opening, and that the use of the alphabet would bar a return to the oral past.”</li>
<li>“It is helpful to distinguish three ways in which a technique affects the human condition. Technical means can be tools in the hand of the engineer. The engineer is faced with a task and for it selects, improves and applies a tool. In a second way, tools have a way of affecting social relations. A telephone-society engenders something new, still called ‘trust’ — toward people whom you address but cannot face. Finally, all tools tend to be themselves powerful metaphors which affect the mind.”</li>
<li>“Professional power over the definition of reality has reached its apogee and is now in decline.”</li>
<li>“The term ‘biology’ was coined early in the nineteenth century by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. He was reacting to the Baroque progress in botany and zoology which tended to reduce these two disciplines to the status of mere classification. By inventing a new term, he also named a new field of study, ‘the science of life.’ Lamarck’s genius confronted the tradition of distinct vegetable and animal ensoulment, along with the consequent division of nature into three kingdoms: mineral, vegetable and animal. He postulated the existence of life that distinguishes living beings from inorganic matter, not by visible structure but by organization.”</li>

<p>joe sachs, st johns college usa sees in aristotle's nichomachean ethics a non–standard translation of hexis as an active state rather than passive habit.<br />
<a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-eth">iep.utm.edu/aris-eth</a></p>
<ul>
<li>his article proceeds to the conclusion that aristotle says that friendship of the kind he praises has the virtue of aiming for the beautiful (to kalon).</li>
<li>the discussion in books viii and ix, according to Joe sachs, is about friendship &quot;in the place of&quot; justice.</li>
<li>notable quote: &quot;justice itself resembles the moral virtue called “friendship” without achieving it, again because it does not govern its action by looking to the beautiful.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;By the end of the ninth book, there is no doubt that Aristotle does indeed believe in a primary sense of the good, at least in the human realm, and that the name of this highest good is the beautiful.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;the beautiful in the Ethics is not an object of contemplation simply, but the source of action: In an article on the Poetics, I discussed the intimate connection of beauty with the experience of wonder. The sense of wonder seems to be the way of seeing which allows things to appear as what they are, since it holds off our tendencies to make things fit into theories or opinions we already hold, or use things for purposes that have nothing to do with them. But this is what Aristotle says repeatedly is the ultimate effect of moral virtue, that the one who has it sees truly and judges rightly, since only to someone of good character do the things that are beautiful appear as they truly are (1113 a, 29-35), that practical wisdom depends on moral virtue to make its aim right (1144a, 7-9), and that the eye of the soul that sees what is beautiful as the end or highest good of action gains its active state only with moral virtue (1144a, 26-33). It is only in the middle ground between habits of acting and between principles of action that the soul can allow right desire and right reason to make their appearance, as the direct and natural response of a free human being to the sight of the beautiful.&quot;</li>

<p>‘No real belief, however trifling and fragmentary it may seem, is ever truly insignificant; it prepares us to receive more of its like, confirms those which resembled it before, and weakens others; and so gradually it lays a stealthy train in our inmost thoughts, which may someday explode into overt action, and leave its stamp upon our character.’</p>

<p><em>friedrich nietzsche’s mental illness – general paralysis of the insane vs. frontotemporal dementia</em><br />
orth m, trimble mr 2006<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0447.2006.00827.x">doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0447.2006.00827.x</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Objective: For a long time it was thought that Nietzsche suffered from general paralysis of the insane (GPI). However, this diagnosis has been questioned recently, and alternative diagnoses have been proposed. Method: We have charted Friedrich Nietzsche’s final fatal illness, and viewed the differential diagnosis in the light of recent neurological understandings of dementia syndromes.<br />
Results: It is unclear that Nietzsche ever had syphilis. He lacked progressive motor and other neurological features of a progressive syphilitic central nervous system (CNS) infection and lived at least<br />
12 years following the onset of his CNS signs, which would be extremely rare for patients with untreated GPI. Finally, his flourish of productivity in 1888 would be quite uncharacteristic of GPI, but in keeping with reports of burgeoning creativity at some point in the progression of frontotemporal dementia (FTD).<br />
Conclusion: We suggest that Nietzsche did not have GPI, but died from a chronic dementia, namely FTD.</li>

<p><em>does mood help or hinder executive functions? reactivity may be the key</em><br />
martyn s. gabel, tara mcauley 2018<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2018.02.027">doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2018.02.027</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Our ability to utilize <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/executive-functions">executive functioning</a> (EF) in day-to-day life is influenced by our mood, which consists of two fundamental dimensions reflecting positive and negative affect. It remains unclear, however, what impact these affective experiences have on our executive skills and whether this association may be influenced by individual differences in emotional reactivity. Our study investigated the interplay of emotional reactivity, naturally occurring variations in affective dimensions underlying mood, and latent constructs of response inhibition and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/working-memory">working memory</a> in an undergraduate sample. Reactivity moderated an association between negative affect and EF, such that high-reactive individuals performed better on EF tasks when experiencing high levels of negative affect whereas low-reactive individuals showed the converse pattern. These results are discussed through the lens of mood-related effects on information processing styles and the availability of cognitive resources to cope with current situational demands. An implication of this work is that emotional reactivity is an important factor in understanding how affective experiences influence executive skills and, by extension, everyday function.</li>

<li>much of what we call morality, and our ability to be moral, is due to our chance environment and circumstances.</li>
<li>to be truly moral we need first, to understand how morality changes with circumstance; secondly, to develop a practice that matches this changing circumstance; and possibly third, to perpetuate similar practices.</li>
<li>what is the nature of this change, and in what manner, if any, can we know it? (change, what can we know, responsibility)</li>
<li>given the stochastic nature of reality, how can we thrive as a society? (probability, precautionary principle, ecological diversity)</li>
<li>what implications does this illuminate in our societal and ecological predicament (illusory truth, perpetuation, oppression)</li>
