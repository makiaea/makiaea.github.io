<p>KUB:  Things we know, believe, and understand. The most secure of truths.</p>
<p>KB:  Things we know and believe, but do not understand. This includes scientific facts that are certainly true, even if we don't understand them. For example, I don't really understand how gravity works, but I know and believe it works. I know and believe that the earth is round, but I don't understand why.</p>
<p>B:  Things we believe, but do not understand or know. These are our axioms, where everything else begins—the things we can't justify using anything else. For example, for me, there are things like love and the preciousness of life. I believe that love is the most important thing of all. I can't explain why, and I can't say I know for sure it is true—because what does that even mean?</p>
<p>After this things get a bit trickier.</p>
<p>K:</p>
<p>Things we know, but do not understand or believe. Is this at all possible? I think if you've ever experienced sudden grief or heartbreak you might have a sense of what this is like. Those numb days after the event when you know, rationally, that it really has happened, but you simply can't believe it, you can't feel it to be true in your stomach. And you certainly don't understand it. Perhaps extremes of good emotions feel like this too. Perhaps if I won the lottery I would, for a while, know that it had happened without understanding or believing it. Winning the lottery of love feels like that too, at least at the height of its ecstasy.</p>
<p>KU:  Things we know and understand, but do not believe. Perhaps this is where we get to the next stage of grieving, when we have come to understand that this terrible thing really has happened, but we still don't believe it. But if you're in this state you're probably in some state of denial, because usually knowing and understanding something would make you really believe it's true.</p>
<p>Finally we have the following sections, which I suspect are empty.</p>

<p><em>positive attitude toward math supports early academic success: behavioral evidence and neurocognitive mechanisms</em><br />
lang chen et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797617735528">http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797617735528</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Positive attitude is thought to impact academic achievement and learning in children, but little is known about its underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. Using a large behavioral sample of 240 children, we found that positive attitude toward math uniquely predicted math achievement, even after we accounted for multiple other cognitive-affective factors. We then investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the link between positive attitude and academic achievement in two independent cohorts of children (discovery cohort: <em>n</em> = 47; replication cohort: <em>n</em> = 28) and tested competing hypotheses regarding the differential roles of affective-motivational and learning-memory systems. In both cohorts, we found that positive attitude was associated with increased engagement of the hippocampal learning-memory system. Structural equation modeling further revealed that, in both cohorts, increased hippocampal activity and more frequent use of efficient memory-based strategies mediated the relation between positive attitude and higher math achievement. Our study is the first to elucidate the neurocognitive mechanisms by which positive attitude influences learning and academic achievement.</li>

<ul>
<li>In this review, we are pitting two theories against each other: the more accepted theory—the ‘number sense’ theory—suggesting that a sense of number is innate and non-symbolic numerosity is being processed independently of continuous magnitudes (e.g., size, area, density); and the newly emerging theory suggesting that (1) both numerosities and continuous magnitudes are processed holistically when comparing numerosities, and (2) a sense of number might not be innate. In the first part of this review, we discuss the ‘number sense’ theory. Against this background, we demonstrate how the natural correlation between numerosities and continuous magnitudes makes it nearly impossible to study non-symbolic numerosity processing in isolation from continuous magnitudes, and therefore the results of behavioral and imaging studies with infants, adults and animals can be explained, at least in part, by relying on continuous magnitudes. In the second part, we explain the ‘sense of magnitude’ theory and review studies that directly demonstrate that continuous magnitudes are more automatic and basic than numerosities. Finally, we present outstanding questions. Our conclusion is that there is not enough convincing evidence to support the number sense theory anymore. Therefore, we encourage researchers not to assume that number sense is simply innate, but to put this hypothesis to the test, and to consider if such an assumption is even testable in light of the correlation of numerosity and continuous magnitudes.</li>

<li>Likelihood estimations are crucial for dealing with the uncertainty of life. Here, infants’ sensitivity to the difference in likelihood between two events was investigated. Infants aged 6, 12, and 18 months (<em>N</em> = 75) were shown animated movies of a machine simultaneously drawing likely and unlikely samples from a box filled with different colored balls. In different trials, the difference in likelihood between the two samples was manipulated. The infants’ looking patterns varied as a function of the magnitude of the difference in likelihood and were modulated by the number of items in the samples. Looking patterns showed qualitative similarities across age groups. This study demonstrates that infants’ looking responses are sensitive to the magnitude of the difference in likelihood between two events.</li>

<p>&quot;We developed the new model to explain one peculiar leaf arrangement pattern. But in fact, it more accurately reflects not only the nature of one specific plant, but the range of diversity of almost all leaf arrangement patterns observed in nature,&quot; said Associate Professor Munetaka Sugiyama from the University of Tokyo's Koishikawa Botanical Garden.</p>
<p>All in the angles</p>
<p>To identify the leaf arrangement of a plant species, botanists measure the angle between leaves, moving up the stem from oldest to youngest leaf.</p>
<p>Common patterns are symmetrical and have leaves arranged at regular intervals of 90 degrees (basil or mint), 180 degrees (stem grasses, like bamboo), or in Fibonacci golden angle spirals (like the needles on some spherical cacti, or the succulent spiral aloe).</p>
<p>The peculiar pattern that Sugiyama's research team studied is called &quot;orixate&quot; after the species Orixa japonica, a shrub native to Japan, China, and the Korean peninsula. O. Japonica is sometimes used as a hedge.</p>
<p>The angles between O. Japonica leaves are 180 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, and then the next leaf resets the pattern to 180 degrees.</p>
<p>&quot;Our research has the potential to truly understand beautiful patterns in nature,&quot; said Sugiyama.</p>
<p>The math of a plant</p>
<p>Sugiyama's research team began their investigation by doing exhaustive testing of the existing mathematical equation used to model leaf arrangement.</p>
<p>Leaf arrangement has been modeled mathematically since 1996 using an equation known as the DC2 (Douady and Couder 2). The equation can generate many, but not all, leaf arrangement patterns observed in nature by changing the value of different variables of plant physiology, such as the relationships between different plant organs or strength of chemical signals within the plant.</p>
<p>The DC2 has two shortcomings that researchers wanted to address:</p>
<p>No matter what values are put into the DC2 equation, certain uncommon leaf arrangement patterns are never calculated.<br />
The Fibonacci spiral leaf arrangement pattern is by far the most common spiral pattern observed in nature, but is only modestly more common than other spiral patterns calculated by the DC2 equation.<br />
A peculiar pattern</p>
<p>At least four unrelated plant species possess the unusual orixate leaf arrangement pattern. Researchers suspected that it must be possible to create the orixate pattern using the fundamental genetic and cellular machinery shared by all plants because the alternative possibility -- that the same, very unusual leaf arrangement pattern evolved four or more separate times -- seemed too unlikely.</p>
<p>One fundamental assumption used in the DC2 equation is that leaves emit a constant signal to inhibit the growth of other leaves nearby and that the signal gets weaker at longer distances. Researchers suspect that the signal is likely related to the plant hormone auxin, but the exact physiology remains unknown.</p>
<p>Rare patterns and common rules</p>
<p>&quot;We changed this one fundamental assumption -- inhibitory power is not constant, but in fact changes with age. We tested both increasing and decreasing inhibitory power with greater age and saw that the peculiar orixate pattern was calculated when older leaves had a stronger inhibitory effect,&quot; said Sugiyama.</p>
<p>This insight into the inhibitory signal power changing with age may be used to direct future studies of the genetics or physiology of plant development.</p>
<p>Researchers call this new version of the equation the EDC2 (Expanded Douady and Couder 2).</p>
<p>First author of the research paper, doctoral student Takaaki Yonekura, designed computer simulations to generate thousands of leaf arrangement patterns calculated by EDC2 and to count how often the same patterns were generated. Patterns that are more commonly observed in nature were more frequently calculated by the EDC2, further supporting the accuracy of the ideas used to create the formula.</p>
<p>&quot;There are other very unusual leaf arrangement patterns that are still not explained by our new formula. We are now trying to design a new concept that can explain all known patterns of leaf arrangement, not just almost all patterns,&quot; said Sugiyama.</p>
<p>Do it yourself -- ID the pattern</p>
<p>Experts recommend looking at a group of relatively new leaves when identifying a plant's leaf arrangement, or phyllotaxis, pattern. (In Greek, phyllon means leaf.) Older leaves may have turned (due to wind or sun exposure), which can make it difficult to identify their true angle of attachment to the stem.</p>
<p>Think of the stem as a circle and begin by carefully observing where on the circle the oldest and second-oldest leaves are attached. The angle between those two leaves is the first &quot;angle of divergence.&quot; Continue identifying the angles of divergence between increasingly younger leaves on the stem. The pattern of angles of divergence is the leaf arrangement pattern.</p>
<p>Common leaf arrangement patterns are distichous (regular 180 degrees, bamboo), Fibonacci spiral (regular 137.5 degrees, the succulent Graptopetalum paraguayense), decussate (regular 90 degrees, the herb basil), and tricussate (regular 60 degrees, Nerium oleander sometimes known as dogbane).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Plant leaves are arranged around the stem in a beautiful geometry that is called phyllotaxis. In the majority of plants, phyllotaxis exhibits a distichous, Fibonacci spiral, decussate, or tricussate pattern. To explain the regularity and limited variety of phyllotactic patterns, many theoretical models have been proposed, mostly based on the notion that a repulsive interaction between leaf primordia determines the position of primordium initiation. Among them, particularly notable are the two models of Douady and Couder (alternate-specific form, DC1; more generalized form, DC2), the key assumptions of which are that each leaf primordium emits a constant power that inhibits new primordium formation and that this inhibitory effect decreases with distance. It was previously demonstrated by computer simulations that any major type of phyllotaxis can occur as a self-organizing stable pattern in the framework of DC models. However, several phyllotactic types remain unaddressed. An interesting example is orixate phyllotaxis, which has a tetrastichous alternate pattern with periodic repetition of a sequence of different divergence angles: 180°, 90°, −180°, and −90°. Although the term orixate phyllotaxis was derived from Orixa japonica, this type is observed in several distant taxa, suggesting that it may reflect some aspects of a common mechanism of phyllotactic patterning. Here we examined DC models regarding the ability to produce orixate phyllotaxis and found that model expansion via the introduction of primordial age-dependent changes of the inhibitory power is absolutely necessary for the establishment of orixate phyllotaxis. The orixate patterns generated by the expanded version of DC2 (EDC2) were shown to share morphological details with real orixate phyllotaxis. Furthermore, the simulation results obtained using EDC2 fitted better the natural distribution of phyllotactic patterns than did those obtained using the previous models. Our findings imply that changing the inhibitory power is generally an important component of the phyllotactic patterning mechanism.</p>

swimming speed is “proportional to the the length of the body in water”. but is this is really the case? actually how it should be said is “all other things being equal, etc.” the length of the body in water is an explanation for speed, not the cause of it. the cause is reducing resistance.</p>

<p><em>on field expediency</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Farming makes much use of what military sorts call ‘field expediency’, the process of making do when you work in conditions that deny you the predictable or standard supplies. My farm is cluttered by products of my grandfather’s genius in field expediency. He built our table saw out of a washtub, salvaged barn oak, a mower engine, and a truck leaf spring. Most things on the farm are made of other, unpredictable things – calf-bottle nipples as tool grips, sheared-off coffee cans as feed scoops, chisel plow blades welded into a child’s sled. Until recently, the farmhouse sported windows retrieved from the wreck of an old hotel, and the insulation was comprised of old clothes. This, then, is field expediency at work. But to make it work, you have to not throw things away.</li>
<li>When I took over the farm following my grandfather’s death, I initially despaired at all the loose bits and pieces that littered the place. Wire was my special enemy, for the barns were everywhere cluttered with it – wire salvaged from telephones, from appliances, from who-could-tell-where. I accumulated buckets of wire with a plan to dispose of them. Mercifully, I never got round to it, for I quickly learned the uncommon worth of wire. For example, it presently holds the muffler to my truck, secures the busted PTO cover on my bushhog, and seams caging around fruit-tree saplings, the better to protect them from the depredations of deer. My only concern about wire now is that I might need more.</li>
<li>The stock images sometimes used to depict the pitiable conditions or pathologies of the rural poor – images of homeplaces surrounded by wreckage and ‘trash’ – tell a bigger story if you know how to read them. The broken-down car in the yard contains parts that still have use in them if need arises. That rusty freezer on the porch probably contains the dog’s food, since nothing beats an old freezer for storing feed where unsanctioned animals can’t get at it. Put plainly, if there is wire everywhere, there’s probably a reason. And if you can’t see the reason, there’s probably a reason for that too.</li>

<p>“You toss it once, and it comes up heads. It’s possible to prove that the probability of a head on the second toss is two out of three using Bayesian probability. However, the initial probability of a head was one out of two, and we didn’t change the coin. The Bayesian viewpoint says that while the first head will not directly affect the probability of the second head, it gives you more information about the coin that allows you to refine your estimate. A coin heavily biased toward tails is highly unlikely to flip heads, and a coin heavily biased toward heads is much more likely to flip heads.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Taking a Bayesian approach also helps avoid a type of paradox first pointed out by German logician Carl Hempel in the 1940s. When people see the same principle, such as the law of gravity, operating without fail over a long period of time, they naturally assume that it’s true with a very high probability. This is inductive reasoning, which can be summed up as follows: if things are observed that are consistent with a theory, then the probability that the theory is true increases. Hempel, however, pointed out a snag with induction, using ravens as an example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All ravens are black, so the theory goes. Every time a raven is seen to be black and no other color—ignoring the fact that there are albino ravens!—our confidence in the theory “All ravens are black” is boosted. Here, though, is the rub. The statement “All ravens are black” is logically equivalent to the statement “All nonblack things are nonravens.” So, if we see a yellow banana, which is a nonblack thing and also a nonraven, it should bolster our belief that all “ravens are black. To get around this highly counterintuitive result, some philosophers have argued that we shouldn’t treat the two sides of the argument as having the same strength. In other words, yellow bananas should make us believe more in the theory that all nonblack things are nonravens (first statement), without influencing the belief that all ravens are black (second statement). This seems to fit with common sense—a banana is a nonraven, so observing one can tell us about nonravens but tells nothing about ravens. But it’s a suggestion that’s been criticized on the basis that you can’t have a different degree of belief in two statements that are logically equivalent, if it’s clear that either both are true or both are false. Maybe our intuition in this matter is at fault, and seeing another yellow banana really should increase the probability that all ravens are black. Adopting a Bayesian stance, however, the paradox never arises. According to Bayes, the probability of a hypothesis H must be multiplied by this ratio:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Probability of observing X if H is true /<br />
Probability of observing X</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>where X is a nonblack object that’s a nonraven and H is the hypothesis that all ravens are black.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you ask someone to select a banana at random and show it to you, then the probability of seeing a yellow banana doesn’t depend on the colors of ravens. You already know beforehand that you’ll see a nonraven. The numerator (the number on top) will equal the denominator (the number on the bottom), the ratio will equal one, and the probability will remain unchanged. Seeing a yellow banana won’t affect your belief about whether all ravens are black. If you ask someone to select a nonblack thing at random and they show you a yellow banana, then the numerator will be bigger than the denominator by a tiny amount. Seeing the yellow banana will only slightly increase your belief that all ravens are black. You would have to see almost every nonblack thing in the universe and see that they were all nonravens before your belief in “All ravens are black” went up significantly. In both cases, the result agrees with intuition.”</p>

<p>“In 1931, several years before leaving Austria and joining the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton, where he became a close friend of Albert Einstein, Gödel published two extraordinary and shocking theorems—his first and second incompleteness theorems. In a nutshell, the first of these theorems showed that any system of mathematics that is complex enough to include ordinary arithmetic—the kind we learn in school—can never be both complete and consistent. If a system is complete, it means that everything within it can be either proved or disproved. If it’s consistent, it means that no statement can be both proved and disproved. Like a bolt out of the blue, Gödel’s incompleteness theorems revealed that, in any mathematical system (apart from the very simplest), there will always be things that are true but that can’t be proved to be true. The incompleteness theorems are analogous in some ways to the uncertainty principle in physics in that they expose fundamental limits to what can be known. And like the uncertainty principle, they’re frustrating and inhibiting because they show that reality—including purely intellectual reality—behaves in ways that prevent us from being omniscient about everything that we try to penetrate with our minds. To put it bluntly, truth is a more powerful concept than proof, which, for a mathematician especially, is anathema.”</p>

<p><em>emissions of tetrachlorobiphenyls (pcbs 47, 51, and 68) from polymer resin on kitchen cabinets as a non-aroclor source to residential air</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Both Aroclor and non-Aroclor sources of airborne polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were found in residential homes. We deployed passive air samplers at 16 residences and found PCB-47, PCB-51, and PCB-68 to account for up to 50% of measured indoor ΣPCBs (2700 pg m–3). Although PCB-47 and PCB-51 are neurotoxins present in Aroclor mixtures (&lt;2.5 and &lt;0.3 wt %, respectively), we found them at much higher levels than expected for any Aroclor source. PCB-68 is not present in Aroclor mixtures. Another non-Aroclor congener, PCB-11, a byproduct of pigment manufacturing, was found inside and outside of every household and was frequently the predominate congener. We conducted direct measurements of surface emissions and identified finished cabinetry to be a major source of PCB-47, PCB-51, and PCB-68. We hypothesize that these congeners are inadvertent byproducts of polymer sealant manufacturing and produced from the decomposition of 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl peroxide used as an initiator in free-radical polymerization of polyester resins. The presence of these three compounds in polymer products, such as silicone, has been widely noted, but to our knowledge they have never been shown to be a significant environmental source of PCBs.</li>

<li>clearing silicone sealant from sealant applicator (conical) nozzle
<ul>
<li>we are using a nozzle that is attached to the sealant tube using plastic screw–thread</li>
<li>the screw–thread is a weak–point and allows the nozzle to be detached easily from the sealant tube body</li>
<li>after using the sealant, cap the nozzle end using cling film and rubber band. this does not prevent air ingress, but will keep the sealant in the nozzle usable for a few days. beyond that, air enters and sets the sealant in the conical nozzle</li>
<li>the set sealant in the nozzle can be removed easily by unscrewing the nozzle, and then using a medium–sized drill bit (attached to a hand–drill) to drill around the inner sides of the nozzle (from the now open larger end of the cone). the silicone sealant stays largely together, and if you drill carefully, the sides of the nozzle cone will be undamaged. the sealant stays together while being displaced by the drilling, and once it has worked loose from most of the nozzle cone, you will be able to pull the entire conical plug out in almost one piece.</li>
<li>finally use a small drill to open a hole into the main sealant tube body, this should hopefully not be difficult or deep as the sealant plug hopefull will have kept air from the main body of the tube. reattach the now–empty nozzle to the main tube body, and use the sealant tube as normal.</li>

<li>life is like slapping on a new coat of paint onto a wooden front door, without cleaning it or removing the seven old layers of paint already on it. very rarely we make the time and effort to prepare the door properly first, carefully scrape off as much of the old paint as we can — because we neither know how nor can spare the immense effort, which is why such craftsmanship is remarkable and rare.</li>

<li>The test where to check the pattern you need to find the card that refutes the theory, not confirms it. popular conception of scientific method is wrong, not searching for confirmation — rather, for verification. we need to look for that single disproof, when it is a true disproof, we can move on to another issue. that is how we can be truly effective in our learning and doing, though almost nobody yet understands this.
<ul>
<li>there may be no way to prove a theory, for theories are not truths. they are guesses, and one of the most effective ways to move forward from a mistaken theory is to find evidence which refutes it. this is what works if you are not emotionally dependent on the theory you are testing, this does not work well if you are reliant on that theory to provide something otherwise missing from your life</li>
