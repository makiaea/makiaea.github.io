<p><em>“i know things they don’t know!” the role of need for uniqueness in belief in conspiracy theories</em><br />
anthony lantian et al. 2017<br />
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1027/1864-9335/a000306">https://doi.org/10.1027/1864-9335/a000306</a></p>
<ul>
<li>In the current research, we investigated whether belief in conspiracy theories satisfies people’s need for uniqueness. We found that the tendency to believe in conspiracy theories was associated with the feeling of possessing scarce information about the situations explained by the conspiracy theories (Study 1) and higher need for uniqueness (Study 2). Further two studies using two different manipulations of need for uniqueness (Studies 3 and 4) showed that people in a high need for uniqueness condition displayed higher conspiracy belief than people in a low need for uniqueness condition. This conclusion is strengthened by a small-scale meta-analysis. These studies suggest that conspiracy theories may serve people’s desire to be unique, highlighting a motivational underpinning of conspiracy belief.</li>

<p><em>too special to be duped: need for uniqueness motivates conspiracy beliefs</em><br />
roland imhoff, pia karoline lamberty 2017<br />
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2265">https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2265</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Adding to the growing literature on the antecedents of conspiracy beliefs, this paper argues that a small part in motivating the endorsement of such seemingly irrational beliefs is the desire to stick out from the crowd, the need for uniqueness. Across three studies, we establish a modest but robust association between the self‐attributed need for uniqueness and a general conspirational mindset (conspiracy mentality) as well as the endorsement of specific conspiracy beliefs. Following up on previous findings that people high in need for uniqueness resist majority and yield to minority influence, Study 3 experimentally shows that a fictitious conspiracy theory received more support by people high in conspiracy mentality when this theory was said to be supported by only a minority (vs. majority) of survey respondents. Together, these findings support the notion that conspiracy beliefs can be adopted as a means to attain a sense of uniqueness.</li>

<p><em>confabulation: why telling ourselves stories makes us feel ok</em><br />

<li>“counterintuitive as it might seem, confabulation can have benefits as well as costs. I suggest that when we confabulate rather than acknowledge ignorance, we construct a better image of ourselves; we integrate disparate information about ourselves into a coherent story; and we share information about ourselves with others.”</li>

<li>cognitive luck
<ul>
<li>“One of the reasons why the notion of bounded rationality is challenged, and more idealized notions of rationality are advocated, is to avoid the phenomenon of cognitive luck, according to which decisions are rational only because the strategy used to arrive at the decision happens to match the structure of the environment in which the decision is made (Matheson 2006). If rationality is a matter of luck, then the prospect for improving our cognitive performance is grim. The challenge for ecological rationality and other notions of bounded rationality is to preserve the normative dimension of rationality. These notions may be really useful to describe what human agents do when they reason in certain environments, but are they also able to provide a framework for the evaluation and enhancement of human reasoning? In other words, is there room for irrationality in the picture of decision-making that Gigerenzer and his colleagues sketch?”</li>
<li>why should “cognitive luck” be avoided? what if it is true, or at least more true than avoiding it?</li>

<li>feyerabend
<ul>
<li>“Paul Feyerabend is one of the most influential authors to argue that anti-rationalism about science constitutes a challenge for the hegemony of science in contemporary society. In a collection of lectures recently made available under the title of The Tyranny of Science (2011), Feyerabend argues for the importance of promoting a variety of human endeavours and interests (i.e., religion, the arts, philosophy and science) and of embracing conflict among them as opposed to attempting to achieve perfect harmony. Conflict is, according to Feyerabend, the key to scientific progress. In a classic work, entitled Against Method, originally published in the 1970s, Feyerabend endorses the proliferation of different methodologies. His slogan is: ‘Anything goes’. Great discoveries are not made by following rigid methodological prescriptions, but are precipitated by random events.”</li>
<li>“[T]he idea of a fixed method, or of a fixed theory of rationality, rests on too naive a view of man and his social surroundings. To those who look at the rich material provided by history, and who are not intent on impoverishing it in order to please their lower instincts, their craving for intellectual security in the form of clarity, precision, ‘objectivity’, ‘truth’, it will become clear that there is only one principle that can be defended under all circumstances and in all stages of human development. It is the principle: anything goes. (Feyerabend 1975: 18–19)</li>
<li>Through the recognition of different ways of thinking, Feyerabend celebrates the openness of mind necessary for embracing new ideas. Successful scientific theories are not based on facts, but on interpretations of facts, and divergences of opinion survive in scientific communities, stimulating further research and resulting in the formation of novel hypotheses to explain long-standing problems. Although other philosophers and sociologists of science have argued against the apparent objectivity of science, and against the alleged superiority of the scientific way of thinking, what makes Feyerabend's work significant in a discourse on the meaning and scope of human rationality is that he was genuinely interested in challenging the identification of the irrational with the unscientific.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Self-narratives can fail to tell true stories about the self, but what is interesting about them is that they have the power to influence or determine an agent’s present and future behaviour. That is why a very effective way for an agent to change behaviour and abandon maladaptive ways of thinking or bad habits is to edit her personal narrative. What Tim Wilson (2013) calls story editing is ‘a set of techniques to redirect people’s narratives about themselves and the social world in a way that leads to lasting changes in behavior’ (p. 155).”</li>

<p><em>social learning and partisan bias in the interpretation of climate trends</em><br />
douglas guilbeault et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1722664115">http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1722664115</a></p>

<p>“But,” Centola adds, “the biggest surprise — and perhaps our biggest lesson — came from how fragile it all was. The improvements vanished completely with the mere suggestion of political party. All we did was put a picture of an elephant and a donkey at the bottom of a screen, and all the social learning effects disappeared. Participants’ inaccurate beliefs and high levels of polarization remained.”<br />
That last finding reveals that even inconspicuous elements of a social media environment or of a media broadcast can hinder bipartisan communications. “Simple ways of framing a political conversation, like incorporating political iconography, can significantly increase the likelihood of polarization,” Guilbeault says.<br />
Instead, Centola says, put people into situations that remove the political backdrop. “Most of us are biased in one way or another. It’s often unavoidable. But, if you eliminate the symbols that drive people into their political camps and let them talk to each other, people have a natural instinct to learn from one another. And that can go a long way toward lessening partisan conflict.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vital scientific communications are frequently misinterpreted by the lay public as a result of motivated reasoning, where people misconstrue data to fit their political and psychological biases. In the case of climate change, some people have been found to systematically misinterpret climate data in ways that conflict with the intended message of climate scientists. While prior studies have attempted to reduce motivated reasoning through bipartisan communication networks, these networks have also been found to exacerbate bias. Popular theories hold that bipartisan networks amplify bias by exposing people to opposing beliefs. These theories are in tension with collective intelligence research, which shows that exchanging beliefs in social networks can facilitate social learning, thereby improving individual and group judgments. However, prior experiments in collective intelligence have relied almost exclusively on neutral questions that do not engage motivated reasoning. Using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, we conducted an online experiment to test how bipartisan social networks can influence subjects’ interpretation of climate communications from NASA. Here, we show that exposure to opposing beliefs in structured bipartisan social networks substantially improved the accuracy of judgments among both conservatives and liberals, eliminating belief polarization. However, we also find that social learning can be reduced, and belief polarization maintained, as a result of partisan priming. We find that increasing the salience of partisanship during communication, both through exposure to the logos of political parties and through exposure to the political identities of network peers, can significantly reduce social learning.</p>

<p><em>false beliefs and confabulation can lead to lasting changes in political attitudes</em><br />
thomas strandberg et al. 2018<br />

<p>The results showed that when participants initially accepted the manipulated responses as their own, their attitudes later on shifted significantly in the direction of the manipulation. However, responses to questions that had not been manipulated kept the same position throughout all the questionnaires.<br />
“This is of particular interest given that it’s the first time lasting attitude change from choice blindness has been shown. Importantly, it shows how false beliefs, and feedback about those beliefs, can powerfully shape the interpretation and memories about one’s political opinions.” Philip Pärnamets, researcher at Karolinska Institutet, points out.<br />
“It seems that part of what it might mean to hold a political attitude is to be able to draw on memories of having stated that attitude. In a sense, me being against tax cuts might result from me remembering having expressed that attitude previously. Using our manipulation, we are able to alter the participants beliefs about themselves, and we find that this leads them to change their attitudes,” he explains.<br />
When comparing those participants that only verified their answers with those who also gave supporting arguments, the researchers found that both groups exhibited lasting opinion changes, but that the effect was much larger for the participants who provided arguments.<br />
“When people argue for a manipulated answer, we know that regardless of what they say, it cannot possibly be the reason for their original choice. This type of confabulation has hardly been studied outside the clinical context, but perhaps it is something we constantly do in our ordinary lives,” main author Thomas Strandberg says.<br />
“We also found that people who started to argue for a manipulated answer, but then suddenly stopped to correct it, still modified their opinions somewhat. These smaller shifts need to be further investigated, but it suggests that even seemingly innocuous amounts of confabulation can impact our attitudes,” he continues.<br />
“On a more positive note, in the current political climate of increasing polarization and ideological hostility, our study shows that people truly have the potential to be flexible in their political views. All that is needed is a way, like choice blindness does, to invite people to reason openly, and unleash their own powers of argumentation,” Thomas Strandberg concludes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In times of increasing polarization and political acrimony, fueled by distrust of government and media disinformation, it is ever more important to understand the cognitive mechanisms behind political attitude change. In two experiments, we present evidence that false beliefs about one’s own prior attitudes and confabulatory reasoning can lead to lasting changes in political attitudes. In Experiment 1 (N = 140), participants stated their opinions about salient political issues, and using the Choice Blindness Paradigm we covertly altered some of their responses to indicate an opposite position. In the first condition, we asked the participants to immediately verify the manipulated responses, and in the second, we also asked them to provide underlying arguments behind their attitudes. Only half of the manipulations were corrected by the participants. To measure lasting attitude change, we asked the participants to rate the same issues again later in the experiment, as well as one week after the first session. Participants in both conditions exhibited lasting shifts in attitudes, but the effect was considerably larger in the group that confabulated supporting arguments. We fully replicated these findings in Experiment 2 (N = 232). In addition, we found that participants’ analytical skill correlated with their correction of the manipulation, whereas political involvement did not. This study contributes to the understanding of how confabulatory reasoning and self-perceptive processes can interact in lasting attitude change. It also highlights how political expressions can be both stable in the context of everyday life, yet flexible when argumentative processes are engaged.</p>

<p><em>cues to lying may be deceptive: speaker and listener behaviour in an interactive game of deception</em><br />
jia e. loy et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/joc.46">http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/joc.46</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Are the cues that speakers produce when lying the same cues that listeners attend to when attempting to detect deceit? We used a two-person interactive game to explore the production and perception of speech and nonverbal cues to lying. In each game turn, participants viewed pairs of images, with the location of some treasure indicated to the speaker but not to the listener. The speaker described the location of the treasure, with the objective of misleading the listener about its true location; the listener attempted to locate the treasure, based on their judgement of the speaker’s veracity. In line with previous comprehension research, listeners’ responses suggest that they attend primarily to behaviours associated with increased mental difficulty, perhaps because lying, under a cognitive hypothesis, is thought to cause an increased cognitive load. Moreover, a mouse-tracking analysis suggests that these judgements are made quickly, while the speakers’ utterances are still unfolding. However, there is a surprising mismatch between listeners and speakers: When producing false statements, speakers are less likely to produce the cues that listeners associate with lying. This production pattern is in keeping with an attempted control hypothesis, whereby liars may take into account listeners’ expectations and correspondingly manipulate their behaviour to avoid detection.</li>

<p><em>a test of the micro‐expressions training tool: does it improve lie detection?</em><br />
sarah jordan et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jip.1532">http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jip.1532</a><br />
answer: no. so whose interests does it serve for this false belief is promoted?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Developed by an influential U.S. psychologist, the Micro-Expressions Training Tool, or METT, inspired the hit TV show Lie to Me, which revolved around the uncanny ability of its lead character to tell truth from falsehood by analysing minute facial tics. And in the real world, METT is being used to train airport personnel to spot people who pose potential security risks.</p>
<p>But a research project involving a University of Huddersfield lecturer has concluded that METT training fails to improve lie detection rates beyond levels that can be achieved by guesswork.</p>
<p>The verdict is reported in a new article which concludes that the failure of METT is highly problematic &quot;given that training in the recognition of micro-expressions composes a large part of a screening system that has become ever more pervasive in our aviation security.&quot;</p>
<p>METT is now an element of the Screening Passengers by Observation Technique (SPOT) used in airport security in the USA. This meant that research into its effectiveness was critical, state the article's authors.</p>
<p>One of them is the University of Huddersfield's Reader in Cognitive Psychology Dr Chris Street, who has made a speciality out of lie detection. He formed a collaboration with colleagues at two universities in the USA who had decided to carry out the first known full test of METT as a lie detection tool.</p>
<p>The findings are revealed in an article that appears in the Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling.</p>
<p>METT-trained individuals performed no better</p>
<p>METT was developed by the psychologist Dr Paul Ekman, whose research group was the inspiration for TV series Lie to Me, starring Tim Roth. It is a form of training that aims to improve the detection of the micro-expressions sadness, anger, fear, disgust, contempt and happiness -- fleeting expressions can last for as little as half a second.</p>
<p>&quot;Recognising micro-expressions may have some utility as an aid for better recognising facial expressions, but it is more prominently promoted as a potential to aid in detecting deception,&quot; according to the new article, which then goes on to state that its research &quot;does not paint an optimistic picture for the utility of METT.&quot;</p>
<p>The article describes the research process, which involved 90 students at a U.S. university. Some were randomly selected to receive METT training and some received bogus &quot;placebo&quot; training or none at all. They were shown stimulus videos containing truths and lies, taken from five different deception detection studies. One them was developed by Dr Street and colleagues.</p>
<p>The success rate of participants in telling truth from lies was then compiled. One of the findings was that METT-trained individuals performed no better than those who received bogus or no training and indeed performed worse than chance -- &quot;guessing would have produced marginally better results.&quot;</p>
<p>Commenting on the research project, Dr Street said: &quot;METT is something that most people in the field felt didn't really hold up. The Ekman group argue that these micro-expressions help you to detect lies. But there really hasn't been any evidence to that effect. The problem now is that it has been brought into government usage in the U.S.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> The purpose of the study was to examine the effectiveness of the micro‐expressions training tool (METT) in identifying and using micro‐expressions to improve lie detection. Participants (n = 90) were randomly assigned to receive training in micro‐expressions recognition, a bogus control training, or no training. All participants made veracity judgements of five randomly selected videos of targets providing deceptive or truthful statements. With the use of the Bayesian analyses, we found that the METT group did not outperform those in the bogus training and no training groups. Further, overall accuracy was slightly below chance. Implications of these results are discussed.</p>

<p><em>a distinct inferential mechanism for delusions in schizophrenia</em><br />
seth c baker et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awz051">http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awz051</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An estimated 80-90 percent of individuals with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders experience delusions -- false, but strongly held, beliefs that can be distressing and debilitating. Researchers have long suspected that delusions are caused by alterations in the ability to make inferences, which relies on observable evidence to shape beliefs. However, previous experiments have suggested that other cognitive processes may be involved.</p>
<p>&quot;The experiments typically used to understand the link between inference and delusions have focused on cognitive and decision-making skills, but they haven't conclusively shown a link between inference-making and delusion severity,&quot; says Guillermo Horga, MD, PhD, the Florence Irving Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and lead author of the paper. &quot;We developed a novel experiment to determine whether delusions stem from abnormalities in inference.&quot;</p>
<p>In the experiment, Horga and his team asked 26 adults with schizophrenia, including 12 who were being treated with antipsychotic medications, and 25 healthy individuals to draw beads from one of two hidden jars. Participants were given money, which could be used to bet on the identity of the hidden jar. They were told that drawing additional beads would help them bet correctly, though it would diminish their winnings. Throughout the experiment, they were asked to rate the odds of their bet on the identity of the jar.</p>
<p>&quot;We found that patients who experienced more severe delusions tended to seek more information in the task before making a guess than their less-delusional counterparts. This is a truly novel finding, and it helps confirm the fact that rigidity is an important part of delusional beliefs,&quot; says Horga.</p>
<p>Using computational modeling, the researchers developed a quantitative framework casting delusions as &quot;sticky&quot; beliefs that evolve in an unusually slow way. This may explain why delusional patients seek more information than non-delusional individuals. It could also help to identify new treatment approaches, such as neurostimulation of the prefrontal brain areas involved in updating beliefs, or cognitive training to shape inference-making.</p>
<p>&quot;Previous work suggested that psychotic patients 'jump to conclusions,' but in our study we saw that individuals with more delusional beliefs took more beads from the jar before they made up their minds,&quot; Horga continues. &quot;While participants with schizophrenia jumped to conclusions more than healthy individuals, delusions specifically were associated with slower change in individuals' beliefs.&quot;</p>
<p>Jeffrey Lieberman, MD, Lawrence C. Kolb Professor and Chairman of Psychiatry at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, commented that &quot;delusions are among the most common and intractable symptoms of psychotic disorders. This innovative research casts delusions in a new context which allows for novel cognitive therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing and disrupting delusional thoughts.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Delusions, a core symptom of psychosis, are false beliefs that are rigidly held with strong conviction despite contradictory evidence. Alterations in inferential processes have long been proposed to underlie delusional pathology, but previous attempts to show this have failed to yield compelling evidence for a specific relationship between inferential abnormalities and delusional severity in schizophrenia. Using a novel, incentivized information-sampling task (a modified version of the beads task), alongside well-characterized decision-making tasks, we sought a mechanistic understanding of delusions in a sample of medicated and unmedicated patients with schizophrenia who exhibited a wide range of delusion severity. In this novel task, participants chose whether to draw beads from one of two hidden jars or to guess the identity of the hidden jar, in order to minimize financial loss from a monetary endowment, and concurrently reported their probability estimates for the hidden jar. We found that patients with higher delusion severity exhibited increased information seeking (i.e. increased draws-to-decision behaviour). This increase was highly specific to delusion severity as compared to the severity of other psychotic symptoms, working-memory capacity, and other clinical and socio-demographic characteristics. Delusion-related increases in information seeking were present in unmedicated patients, indicating that they were unlikely due to antipsychotic medication. In addition, after adjusting for delusion severity, patients as a whole exhibited decreased information seeking relative to healthy individuals, a decrease that correlated with lower socioeconomic status. Computational analyses of reported probability estimates further showed that more delusional patients exhibited abnormal belief updating characterized by stronger reliance on prior beliefs formed early in the inferential process, a feature that correlated with increased information seeking in patients. Other decision-making parameters that could have theoretically explained the delusion effects, such as those related to subjective valuation, were uncorrelated with both delusional severity and information seeking among the patients. In turn, we found some preliminary evidence that subjective valuation (rather than belief updating) may explain group differences in information seeking unrelated to delusions. Together, these results suggest that abnormalities in belief updating, characterized by stronger reliance on prior beliefs formed by incorporating information presented earlier in the inferential process, may be a core computational mechanism of delusional ideation in psychosis. Our results thus provide direct empirical support for an inferential mechanism that naturally captures the characteristic rigidity associated with delusional beliefs.</p>

<p><em>understanding and countering the motivated roots of climate change denial</em><br />
gabrielle wong-parodi, irina feygina 2020<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2019.11.008">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2019.11.008</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Denying the effects of climate change serves as a barrier to taking the actions needed to mitigate the worst effects, including rising seas, more intense hurricanes and increased droughts and heatwaves. However, the researchers found that those who deny human causes for climate change can be swayed through conversations that appeal to their different identities, reframe solutions — or even embrace their climate views.<br />
“I think in the climate change sphere there’s this thinking of, ‘there’s the deniers over there, let’s just not even engage with them — it’s not worth it,’” said behavioral scientist Gabrielle Wong-Parodi, lead author of the paper published in <em>Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability</em> Jan. 8. “A lot of the tactics and strategies start from the point that something is wrong with the climate deniers, rather than trying to acknowledge that they have a belief and opinion and it matters. But I think there is an opportunity to keep trying to understand one another, especially now.”<br />
The researchers focused on what is referred to as “motivated denial” — knowing or having access to the facts, but nevertheless denying them. For some people, accepting that humans cause climate change questions self-worth, threatens financial institutions and is accompanied by an overwhelming sense of responsibility.<br />
Although efforts to sway climate deniers may seem futile, the researchers found four approaches in peer-reviewed studies from the past two years that could be most effective:<br />
•    1. Reframing solutions to climate change as ways to uphold the social system and work toward its stability and longevity 2. Reducing the ideological divide by incorporating the purity of the Earth, rather than how we harm or care for it</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Having conversations about the scientific consensus around climate change with trusted individuals</li>
<li>Encouraging people to explicitly discuss their values and stance on climate change prior to engaging with climate information<br />
Wong-Parodi said she found the fourth approach to be the most intriguing because less research has been done in that area than the other three — and it seems to have a lot of potential for behavior change. Self-affirmation is challenged when people face climate change because it requires them to consider their contribution to the problem, which can threaten their sense of integrity and trigger self-defense.<br />
“A good portion of people who deny climate change recognize that there is some change, but the change is so threatening because it basically could affect your quality of life. It could affect your income. It could affect a number of different things that you care about,” said Wong-Parodi, an assistant professor of Earth system science at Stanford’s School of Earth, Energy &amp; Environmental Sciences (Stanford Earth).<br />
Some preliminary studies suggest that rather than trying to get around people’s identities and denial of climate change, conversations should instead embrace their views. We should not try to ignore who people are, but rather acknowledge their views so that they can be dealt with and the conversation can move on to behavioral changes — such as finding solutions that match their values and do not threaten a person’s sense of identity or quality of life, according to Wong-Parodi.<br />
“I think we often forget that people can have many identities — there might be a political identity, but there is also an identity as a mother, or an identity as a friend or an identity as a student,” said Wong-Parodi, who is also a fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. “You can elicit other identities when you’re talking about climate change that may be more effective.”</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Action on climate change is currently minimal, and woefully inadequate for steering away from its worst trajectories and impacts. Psychological science offers insights into the causes of climate change denial and reluctance to engage with solutions, and identifies avenues for enhancing climate acceptance and engagement. We review psychological processes that underlie denial, and survey promising directions for fostering support for solutions. We draw largely on studies conducted in the United States, whose population is exceptionally high on climate denial and disengagement, and where the majority of research has focused. However, these approaches provide insight into underlying psychological dynamics that can inform broader efforts to engage audiences with climate change.</p>

<p><strong>The TERFS are Going Mainstream; Inside My Local TERF Group</strong><br />
I’ve been hesitating about this post for a while, and for a variety of reasons. However, watching the reactions of TERF and SWERF groups to the recent <a href="https://www.transiness.com/blog/search/.hash.blacklivesmatter">#BlackLivesMatter</a> protests, and attempts by the trans and sex worker movements to bring attention to the discrimination and police brutality suffered by black and trans sex workers, I knew now was the time to post. The fact that local ‘gender-critical’ feminist groups are now popping up everywhere and organising over social media (including, of course, Mumsnet) is something that I believe needs drawing attention to if we are to fully combat the insidious reach of this ideological cult.</p>
<p>I have written previously about my experience with abolitionist feminists as a survivor of abuse within the sex industry and a former sex worker, and how I was initially sucked in by their claims to want to liberate women from abuse. I have mentioned how these ‘feminists’ were always the same women who described themselves as ‘gender critical’ and against Self-ID, and how this always descended into abject mockery of trans women. Perhaps out of shame at my own complicity in this for a time, I have resisted writing in great detail about this aspect. But as the movement continues to grow and transphobia to rise, I cannot stay silent.</p>
<p>No doubt, another reason I have resisted writing is because I counted some of these women as my friends. I feel a sense of ‘being a traitor’ in writing this - something the trolls have already accused me of simply for turning my back on the Nordic Model. But it is my hope that at least some of those women, if they see this, will take some time to reflect on their damaging and harmful beliefs.</p>
<p>￼<br />
￼<br />
I was invited to join a local feminist group by a woman I knew quite well, which she had organised over Facebook. The main thrust of the group was that it was radical feminist, and the consensus was that trans women were not allowed (yet they still insisted that the incredibly apt acronym ‘TERF’ was a slur). My friend had herself come to this conclusion by going to radfem conferences, reading their writings and joining groups on social media. She sent me a lot of information on how TRAs (trans rights activists) were forming cults and seeking to take over women’s spaces and even get rid of the word ‘woman.’ But all of the trans women I had known and loved were nothing like this, I protested. I was told this was different, that there was an insidious and well funded lobby that were seeking to roll back women’s rights and were none other than ‘mens rights activists in dresses.’ Quite why I gave this any consideration, looking back, I don’t truly understand. I was in the grip of the abolos at this point and going through some severe trauma processing, but this is really no excuse for being so gullible.<br />
The group was named ‘FWOC’ for ‘Feminist Women of Coventry’ and consisted of all white and predominantly upper-middle-class women. A university professor. A doctor. A tribunal judge. There was also a women’s services manager, a counsellor at a women’s service and an IDVA (independent domestic violence survivor). As a working-class, former sex worker and drug addict, I immediately felt out of place. However, as someone who was doing the survivor speaker circuit, I was constantly told how brave and inspiring I was. On reflection, I wanted these women’s approval.</p>
<p>Because these were relatively powerful women. Women who wield a great deal of privilege in their local communities, and this is where it all becomes quite sinister, because policy-makers and officials listen to these women, undoubtedly a great deal more than they do transwomen or sex workers. While these women bleated on about having their rights taken away and being persecuted, they were living privileged lives, never having to worry about where their next meal was coming from, or being hassled by cops or social services. The cops and social services were their friends.<br />

<p>I tried on occasion to talk about class, and was ignored. I tried to point out that most trans people are simply trying to survive, and was told ‘oh, but we don’t hate trans women, we just want them to stop pretending to be women.’ When I gathered up enough courage to tell them that I had had a relationship with a trans woman and had never seen her as anything but a woman - because indeed, that is what she was - I was stared at as though I had suddenly sprouted two heads. For the first time in my life I felt ashamed of that relationship, as though I had done something wrong and my sexuality (bi/pan) was now something to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>It’s probably worth pointing out here that few of the women in this particular group were lesbians or actually in any way radical in their ‘feminism’. At least half were married to wealthy white men. If there is anything I particularly want to expose in this article it is that TERFs are not simply a fringe group. They are mainstream.</p>
<p>‘Resisting the trans cult’ was on the agenda at every single meeting. Often meetings descended into nothing more than mocking prominent trans women. Munroe Bergdorf, a trans woman of colour, seemed to come in for particular vitriol, and this seemed to be based on little more than the fact that she is highly attractive. It was this point I realised that the object of their hatred wasn’t the supposed ‘TRA cult’ but just trans women, period. Trans men were viewed with pity and condescension. Trans women were the enemy, because they were ‘men’ (the levels of misandry, even amongst the married women, were also shocking).</p>
<p>And trans women couldn’t win. If they ‘passed’ they were appropriating. If they didn’t ‘pass’ they were ‘fake.’ Books by Janice Raymond, Germaine Greer and Sheila Jeffreys were handed around as though they were sacred texts. Posie Parker videos were watched as though they were broadcasts from the Queen (who I don’t approve of either). The final straw for me, at which point I knew I could no longer sit in silence and swallow the rhetoric being pushed, was when Posie Parker stickers saying ‘Woman = Adult Human Female’ were ordered in bulk and a sticker campaign started. Unisex toilets were the target. When I protested that this was bullying and could seriously distress a trans person who came across these I was told ‘well they shouldn’t be there in the first place.’ There was no discussion of where they should then go if even unisex toilets were out of bounds.</p>
<p>I left, giving my awful experiences with the abolos as my reason, still not brave enough to voice exactly what I thought about their transphobia. I am angry with myself about this, but I also know that sitting in my guilt serves no-one. Instead, I will speak up about what I saw, and commit to being a better trans ally from now on, and that starts with exposing this nonsense, because it is dangerous nonsense. While a bunch of privileged white cis women having clandestine meetings to talk about their transphobia may seem laughable and risible, the fact is that these attitudes are growing and spreading. Women are being radicalised on Mumsnet (this is a common story that I was told by the women themselves) convinced that their reproductive and parenting rights are being challenged. TERFs, just like SWERFs, use peoples biggest fears to convince them of their views. Tell mothers that TRAs are after their children, tell rape survivors that trans women are rapists, and you have easy targets for radicalisation.</p>
<p>We - by which I mean allies, as trans folk and sex workers have no choice to ignore them - need to start taking TERFs and SWERFs seriously as hate groups, and reaching those who are vulnerable to their ideological brainwashing. Allies need to do better (yes, I am pointing those fingers back at myself) to protect trans folk and sex workers and amplify their voices. Particularly, at this time, the voices of those who are of colour and live under police brutality.</p>

<p><em>denial: self-deception, false beliefs, and the origins of the human mind</em><br />
ajit varki, danny brower 2013</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>negative selection</em><br />
here speculates fear of death as barrier to evolution of humans. optimism as reality–denial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if so, does our strong ability to resist existential angst (fear of our own mortality), while contemplating disaster (as opposed to denying or ignoring danger), make us super–optimists, a particular subset in the diverse array of human possibility? is this related to our ability to make things work by strengthening possible–weak points, and developing diverse skills to do so in different situations?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Danny suggested that we humans were the only species to finally get past this long-standing barrier. And he posited that we did this by simultaneously evolving mechanisms to deny our mortality.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“He wrote that the human penchant to deny our mortality is but one manifestation of our overall ability to deny many other things—a propensity that has many ramifications, positive and negative.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“An unconscious defense mechanism used to reduce anxiety by denying thoughts, feelings, or facts that are consciously intolerable”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“this human ability extends all the way from denial of personal health issues to our denial of the “mortality” of our planet’s biosphere and climate in its present form. Even those of us who realize that the earth’s climate and environment are being degraded by human activities tend to deny the urgency of the problem in our daily actions.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“contrary to the popular misconception, Darwin did not use the phrase “survival of the fittest” until later editions of his famous book On the Origin of Species. This catchy expression was actually coined by the economist and philosopher Herbert Spencer in his 1864 book, The Principles of Biology, because he mistakenly saw parallels between his economic theories and Darwin’s biological theory of natural selection. And we now know from the insights of Motoo Kimura and others that natural selection is happening against a backdrop of neutral evolution (random changes that are not detrimental to survival and reproduction and that are able to persist for this reason). In addition, depending on the circumstances, there can be “survival of the luckiest.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Wallace challenged his own basic theory, saying that he did not understand how natural selection could have “preselected” for such human abilities well ahead of the time when they might be useful. He asked, “How could ‘natural selection,’ or survival of the fittest in the struggle for existence, at all favor the development of mental powers so entirely removed from the material necessities of savage men?” And he concluded that the human mind was “an instrument…developed in advance of the needs of its predecessor.” (<em>Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection</em>, 1870)”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but what if what was being selected for was not “fitness” but rather “possible–diversity”? this would seem to “fit” the conditions and result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<em>Baldwin effect</em>: a very simplified version is as follows. Within a species capable of learning, an individual may have genetic abilities that increase the possibility of learning something new and useful. If that something happens to be beneficial for the whole species, others within the population can pick up the behavior because of their own abilities to learn. Initially they may not be as successful because they do not have the intrinsic genetic ability. But if the behavior creates a niche that is beneficial for the whole group, there will eventually be environmental selection for individuals who are best capable of carrying out the useful behavior. And if this improves the reproductive fitness of those individuals, the genetic ability would spread more rapidly than it would have by conventional natural selection. In this manner postnatal learning might bootstrap, or accelerate, the rate at which new behaviors can become part and parcel of the genetically endowed abilities of a species. But it is important to note that the second stage of the Baldwin effect involves genetic “fixation” of the behavior in the species, so that it eventually becomes instinctive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Critics correctly point out that the Baldwin effect has never been formally proved or demonstrated. And a much more refined and modern concept is Marcus Feldman’s concept of niche construction, which applies not only to culture but also to nonlearned behaviors.18 Anyway, given its relevance to postnatal learning, the Baldwin effect has been suggested more than once as a mechanism to explain the evolution of some of our unique human behaviors and abilities. Indeed, we humans could have experienced a Baldwin effect “on steroids,” because of our much superior ability to learn, imitate, and pass on ideas, even beyond the immediate group that observes the original behavior. But, as we said, the first stage of the Baldwin effect is intrinsically unstable because it depends mostly on postnatal learning, a risky thing to rely on for all future environmental circumstances. Thus the second stage of the Baldwin effect, in which the behavior in question eventually becomes genetically hardwired as an instinctive feature of the species, is critical. However, we humans have apparently evolved to not bother with the second stage of the Baldwin effect. While we have invented a great many unusual behaviors (many of them beneficial to our species), essentially all of them continue to require learning by observation and teaching from the previous generation. In other words, we have simply off-loaded the second phase of the Baldwinian mechanism to culture and learning alone, using our many increasingly sophisticated ways of communicating across barriers of time and space. While this would be a risky proposition for other species, we can get away with it, as long as we have a sufficient population size, or a sufficient number of individuals who can remember ideas and pass them on. And with the advent of writing, computers, and the Internet, we are now largely assured that our accumulated knowledge will be passed on to posterity.”</p>

<p>“The exception may be the experiment done by the Mogul emperor Akbar the Great (1542–1605), which was recorded in his biography, the Akbarnāma.27 Beyond the fact that it is relatively recent, this story is more plausible, because the Akbarnāma is a rare instance in which an intellectually honest monarch apparently asked his biographer to accurately record all information, whether it reflected negatively or positively on him. During an argument about language origins, Akbar is said to have postulated that babies raised without hearing human speech would be unable to speak. To gain experimental proof, the Akbarnāma states, he “had a serai built in a place which civilized sounds did not reach. The newly born were put into that place of experience, and honest and active guards were put over them. For a time tongue-tied wet-nurses were admitted there. As they had closed the door of speech, the place was commonly called the Gung Mahal (the dumb-house).” Some time later Akbar was apparently in the vicinity and “he went with a few special attendants to the house of experiment. No cry came from that house of silence, nor was any speech heard there. In spite of their four years they had no part of the talisman of speech, and nothing came out except the noise of the dumb.” The likelihood that this experiment did take place is reinforced by other contemporary accounts, such as a letter by Father Jerome Xavier,28 written in 1598 from Akbar’s court: “He [Akbar] told me that nearly twenty years ago he had thirty children shut up before they could speak, and put guards over them so that the nurses might not teach them their language. His object was to see what language they would talk when they grew older, and he resolved to follow the laws and customs of the country whose language was that spoken by the children. But his endeavours were a failure, for none of the children came to speak distinctly.” This “palace of silence” experiment is also described in another contemporary account:29 “An order was issued that several suckling infants should be kept in a secluded place far from habitations, where they should not hear a word spoken. Well-disciplined nurses were to be placed over them, who were to refrain from giving them any instruction in speaking….To carry out this order, about twenty sucklings were taken from their mothers for a consideration in money, and were placed in an empty house, which got the name of Dumb-house. After three or four years the children all came out dumb, excepting some who died there.” So it appears that the human mind, like a computer, may be a “nothing in, nothing out” type of mechanism. The basic “operating system” is available, but it needs input and programming. And where does the human mind get most of its input? From other human minds!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Whatever the mechanism, we are living in an unusually stable period called the Holocene epoch. It is only because of this stable climate that we have so successfully populated the world while optimizing our homes, facilities, and agriculture <em>to suit a relatively predictable local climate in each location</em>.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“It is particularly ironic, then, that Sandy is a diminutive for Cassandra, the mythical and tragic daughter of the king of Troy.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“it is probably essential for our long-term success that we embrace the idea that reality denial is a fundamental part of human nature. For only by knowing this enemy can we consciously change our innate, destructive behavioral tendencies. Ironically, many readers of this statement are likely to deny the important point we are making. In other words, <em>we are in a state of denial about our denial of reality</em>, and this is not an easy problem to overcome on a daily basis.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“the first step is recognition of the problem. The next step may require a process that is every bit as unlikely as the convergence of self-awareness and self-deception that allowed us to break through the wall so many years ago. It required millions of years for the latter event to occur. We don’t have that much time to solve our current dilemma.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“While a few forms of meditation focus on gaining an increased awareness of reality, the common goal of most meditation methods is to deny reality by deliberately eliminating extraneous thoughts and focusing on only a few (in the extreme form, to focus on one single word or sound—or, even better, on nothing at all). In the final analysis, such deep meditation amounts to a deliberate and sustained effort at maximal denial of the reality surrounding an individual, both physical and mental. Perhaps this is why many forms of meditation (or “mindfulness”) are shown to make humans happier and healthier.”</p>

<li>
<p>my point isn’t that X or Y are biased or wrong, it is that we are all biased and wrong most of the time, so what do we do?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>taboos are like uncharted reefs in our lives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>denial</p>
<ul>
<li>when people feel they need to defend their sense of self, they will not be able to grow. denial of reality is perhaps the worst manifestation of this</li>
<li>you might as well give up completely on someone who is self–righteous. because their ability to question their way of life is no longer available, all they will hear from you is criticism, since they are so far from reality that there is little with which you can agree with them, and even then their interpretation is negative. sadly, if your spouse, family or best friend is self–righteous, although you do not want to leave them, eventually to preserve your life you will need to. it is so difficult to weather the unceasing burden that the self–righteous impose on us.</li>
<li>like visual blind spots, the beliefs that control us make holes in our perception of reality — we literally do not sense or interpret many parts of what is there — and also make illusions from what we take in</li>
<li>worst atrocities perpetuated by those who believe themselves pure. this is not rejecting purity, rather it is acknowledging truth. this is the mechanism by which we deny the consequences of our actions.
<ul>
<li>to deal with this denial, look at the results of your actions, not what you feel about what you have done.</li>
<li>just because the results of our actions does not fit our images of ourselves as innocent pure beings, is no justification to deny their reality. we need to deal with reality and address this denial.</li>
<li>it is often counter–productive to criticize someone who is in denial, as they would have done better if they could. just get on with your life and try to minimize the effect their actions have on your life if you can.</li>
<li>the unfortunate reality is that almost all people in the world are in denial</li>
<li>pay attention to what they do, don't get too enamoured with what they say. if they say one thing but do another…</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>saying no is as important as saying yes, but when someone only knows how to say no, they will lose many opportunities in life.
<ul>
<li>religious fundamentalism is only one of the most obvious ways of saying no.</li>
<li>refusing to consider different views or denying they have any validity or misunderstanding what someone means without trying to really understand it first — these are more subtle ways of saying no but they are still ways of saying no nonetheless</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>vested interest is not criticism of individual motivations but tendency for aggregate to behave in a self–interested manner</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>delusion</p>
<ul>
<li>delusions, and their product, abuse, are ways of avoiding certain aspects of life. what are we avoiding? the injunction, “deal with it”, is to face what we are avoiding, to change the delusion and abuse to something more benign.</li>
<li>reading someone’s work is like finding a partial key to their delusions — i wonder what you can find in our writing, that we do not know?</li>
<li>false memories, delusional thinking, mental illness; they are all part of the same issue — what we believe is often not true, and sometimes very damagingly untrue, even if we do not appreciate or understand that it is so.</li>
