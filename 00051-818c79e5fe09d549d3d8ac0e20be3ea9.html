<p><em>want to bring a community together? create more sub-communities</em><br />
chen luo, anshumali shrivastava 2018<br />

<li><em>abstract</em> Understanding overlapping community structures is crucial for network analysis and prediction. AGM (Affiliation Graph Model) is one of the favorite models for explaining the densely overlapped community structures. In this paper, we thoroughly re-investigate the assumptions made by the AGM model on real datasets. We find that the AGM model is not sufficient to explain several empirical behaviors observed in popular real-world networks. To our surprise, all our experimental results can be explained by a parameter-free hypothesis, leading to more straightforward modeling than AGM which has many parameters. Based on these findings, we propose a parameter-free Jaccard-based Affiliation Graph (JAG) model which models the probability of edge as a network specific constant times the Jaccard similarity between community sets associated with the individuals. Our modeling is significantly simpler than AGM, and it eliminates the need of associating a parameter, the probability value, with each community. Furthermore, JAG model naturally explains why (and in fact when) overlapping communities are densely connected. Based on these observations, we propose a new community-driven friendship formation process, which mathematically recovers the JAG model. JAG is the first model that points towards a direct causal relationship between tight connections in the given community with the number of overlapping communities inside it. Thus, <em>the most effective way to bring a community together is to form more sub-communities within it.</em> The community detection algorithm based on our modeling demonstrates a significantly simple algorithm with state-of-the-art accuracy on six real-world network datasets compared to the existing link analysis based methods.</li>

<p><em>concern for others leads to vicarious optimism</em><br />

<li>An optimistic learning bias leads people to update their beliefs in response to better-than-expected good news but neglect worse-than-expected bad news. Because evidence suggests that this bias arises from self-concern, we hypothesized that a similar bias may affect beliefs about other people’s futures, to the extent that people care about others. Here, we demonstrated the phenomenon of <em>vicarious optimism</em> and showed that it arises from concern for others. Participants predicted the likelihood of unpleasant future events that could happen to either themselves or others. In addition to showing an optimistic learning bias for events affecting themselves, people showed vicarious optimism when learning about events affecting friends and strangers. Vicarious optimism for strangers correlated with generosity toward strangers, and experimentally increasing concern for strangers amplified vicarious optimism for them. These findings suggest that concern for others can bias beliefs about their future welfare and that optimism in learning is not restricted to oneself.</li>

<p><em>shared plates, shared minds: consuming from a shared plate promotes cooperation</em><br />
kaitlin woolley, ayelet fishbach 2018<br />
<a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ayelet.fishbach/research/shared_plates%20in%20press.pdf">http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ayelet.fishbach/research/shared_plates%20in%20press.pdf</a></p>

<p>When people in a business negotiation share not just a meal but a plate, they collaborate better and reach deals faster, according to new research from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.</p>
<p>In the study, &quot;Shared Plates, Shared Minds: Consuming from a Shared Plate Promotes Cooperation,&quot; forthcoming in Psychological Science, Chicago Booth Professor Ayelet Fishbach and Cornell University's Kaitlin Woolley, a Booth PhD student at the time of the research, asked: could the way a meal is served and consumed boost cooperation?</p>
<p>Sharing plates is customary in Chinese and Indian cultures, among others. Because the custom requires people to coordinate their physical actions, it might in turn prompt them to coordinate their negotiations.</p>
<p>To find out, they asked study participants, all strangers to one another, to pair off in a lab experiment that involved negotiating. The participants were invited to have a snack of chips and salsa with their partners. Half of the pairs received one bowl of chips and one bowl of salsa to share, while the others each had their own bowls.</p>
<p>Next came the negotiation scenario, in which one person in each pair was randomly assigned to act as management and the other as a union representative. Their goal was to arrive at an acceptable wage for the union within 22 rounds of negotiation, with each round representing one day of negotiations, and with a costly union strike scheduled to start on the third round. The costs of the strike accrued quickly for both sides, giving the parties an impetus to reach a mutually agreeable deal quickly.</p>
<p>Teams with shared bowls took nine strike days, on average, to reach a deal, four fewer than pairs that had eaten from separate bowls. This difference translated into significant dollar values, saving both parties a combined, if hypothetical, $1.5 million in losses.</p>
<p>This phenomenon, the researchers write, was unrelated to how two people in a negotiating team felt about each other. Rather, what mattered was how well they coordinated their eating.</p>
<p>When Woolley and Fishbach repeated the experiment with both friends and strangers participating, friends arrived at a negotiation agreement faster than strangers did, but sharing plates had a significant effect for both groups. The degree to which a person felt she was collaborating with her partner while eating -- sharing food rather than competing for that last bite -- predicted her feelings of collaboration during the negotiation phase.</p>
<p>Fishbach says that while technology allows people to conduct meetings remotely, there is value in getting together over a meal. And the same is true outside of business negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically, every meal that you're eating alone is a missed opportunity to connect to someone,&quot; says Fishbach. &quot;And every meal that involves food sharing fully utilizes the opportunity to create that social bond.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> A meal naturally brings people together, but does the way a meal is served and consumed further matter for cooperation between people? This research (n = 1476) yielded evidence that it does. People eating from shared plates (i.e., Chinese style meal) cooperated more in social dilemmas and negotiations than those eating from separate plates. Specifically, sharing food from a single plate increased perceived coordination among diners, which in turn led them to behave more cooperatively and less competitively toward each other compared with individuals eating the same food from separate plates. The effect of sharing a plate on cooperation occurred among strangers, which suggests that sharing plates can bring together not only allies, but strangers as well.</p>

<li>Making friends is critical to well-being. We also live in a society where the display of status is ubiquitous and billions of dollars are spent on high-status consumer goods. In the present analysis, we introduce the <em>Status Signals Paradox</em>: When making new friends, people tend to think that displaying high-status markers of themselves (e.g., a BMW, a Tag Heuer watch) will make them more attractive to others than neutral markers (e.g., a Honda, a generic brand watch); however, from the perspective of would-be friends, individuals who display high-status markers are found to be <em>less</em> attractive as new friends than those with neutral status markers. Six studies provide converging evidence of the status signals paradox.</li>

<p><em>eye blinks are perceived as communicative signals in human face-to-face interaction</em><br />
paul hömke et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0208030">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0208030</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Humans blink about 13,500 times a day -- much more frequently than is necessary for lubricating the eyeballs. Additionally, studies have shown that blinks often occur at natural pauses in conversation. Hömke wondered whether a movement as tiny and subliminal as blinking could act as conversational feedback, just like nodding one's head.</p>
<p>To test this idea, the researchers developed a new, virtual reality-based experimental set-up where humans talk with an avatar that acts as a &quot;virtual listener.&quot; Volunteers answered questions such as &quot;How was your weekend?&quot; while researchers controlled the avatar's nonverbal responses, using short and long blinks that each lasted less than a second.</p>
<p>The experiments showed that speakers perceived the subtle difference between short and long blinks, with longer blinks eliciting substantially shorter answers from the volunteers. None of the participants reported noticing any variation in the avatar's blinking, suggesting that the speaker picked up on the different cues unconsciously.</p>
<p>Taken together, the findings indicate that even subtle behaviour such as blinking can serve as a type of nonverbal communication that impacts face-to-face communication. The study also reinforces the idea that a conversation is a joint activity, involving contributions from both the speaker and the listener. More generally, the discovery may add to our understanding of the origins of how humans signal their mental state, which has evolved to be a crucial ingredient in everyday social interactions.</p>
<p>The authors add: &quot;Our findings show that one of the subtlest of human movements -- eye blinking -- appears to have a surprising effect on the coordination of everyday human interaction.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> In face-to-face communication, recurring intervals of mutual gaze allow listeners to provide speakers with visual feedback (e.g. nodding). Here, we investigate the potential feedback function of one of the subtlest of human movements—eye blinking. While blinking tends to be subliminal, the significance of mutual gaze in human interaction raises the question whether the interruption of mutual gaze through blinking may also be communicative. To answer this question, we developed a novel, virtual reality-based experimental paradigm, which enabled us to selectively manipulate blinking in a virtual listener, creating small differences in blink duration resulting in ‘short’ (208 ms) and ‘long’ (607 ms) blinks. We found that speakers unconsciously took into account the subtle differences in listeners’ blink duration, producing substantially shorter answers in response to long listener blinks. Our findings suggest that, in addition to physiological, perceptual and cognitive functions, listener blinks are also perceived as communicative signals, directly influencing speakers’ communicative behavior in face-to-face communication. More generally, these findings may be interpreted as shedding new light on the evolutionary origins of mental-state signaling, which is a crucial ingredient for achieving mutual understanding in everyday social interaction.</p>

<p><em>social support drives female dominance in the spotted hyaena</em><br />
colin vullioud et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41559-018-0718-9">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41559-018-0718-9</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Spotted hyaena females are often portrayed as archetypes of powerful and ferocious females. They are on average heavier than the males, have highly masculinised outer genitalia (a ‘pseudo-penis’ and a ‘pseudo-scrotum’), and usually occupy the highest position in the society. But according to the new study, it is not their manliness that allows them to dominate males. “When two hyaenas squabble, the one that can rely on greater social support wins, irrespective of sex, body mass or aggressiveness,” explains Oliver Hoener, head of the Ngorongoro Hyena Project of the Leibniz-IZW. Differences in social support between two individuals correctly predicted who will be the dominant in almost all encounters and in all contexts — between natives and immigrants, members of the same and different clans, residents and intruders, and individuals of the same and opposite sex. Female dominance thus emerges from females being more likely to receive greater social support than males. “What is so fascinating is that it all works without any direct involvement of other hyaenas,” says Colin Vullioud, Hoener’s colleague at Leibniz-IZW and first author of the study. “In the end, it’s all about assertiveness and how confident a hyaena is of receiving support if needed.”<br />
For their study, the scientists analysed the outcome of 4133 agonistic interactions between 748 hyaenas from eight different clans monitored for 21 years in the Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania. To estimate potential social support, they developed an algorithm that predicted for each clan member, which of two interacting hyaenas it would support; this algorithm was derived from behavioural observations of social support and relatedness estimates based on one of the most comprehensive pedigrees of a free-ranging mammal. “To tease apart the effects of social support and intrinsic attributes such as body mass, one needs to evaluate each effect while controlling for the presence of the other” explains Francois Rousset (ISEM), who has developed statistical methods for such purposes. “When this is done, the effects of sex and body mass appear negligible.”<br />
In many social contexts, female and male hyaenas can rely on equal social support and are equally likely to win. But there is one exception: when natives interact with immigrant clan members. “Hyaena society is highly nepotistic and social support is primarily given to kin. Native clan members live among their relatives and have a competitive advantage over immigrants because immigrants lose their social bonds when they disperse from home” explains Eve Davidian (Leibniz-IZW), co-first author of the study. “In this context, females have the upper hand because immigrants are usually males.” Female dominance in spotted hyaenas is therefore driven by the sex bias in dispersal and the demographic structure of the clan: when the clan contains a high proportion of immigrant males, female dominance is nearly absolute. But when the clan contains many native males, males win almost as often as females and the sexes are co-dominant.<br />
“Identifying the determinants of dominance relationships between the sexes is fundamental to understanding the evolution of reproductive strategies, gender roles, and sexual conflicts,” concludes Alexandre Courtiol (Leibniz-IZW), co-senior author of the study. “Our findings show that social dominance of one sex over the other — a trait that characterises gender roles — does not need to be a direct consequence of sex or physical strength, but can be shaped by the social environment.” By demonstrating the key role of social support in mediating the establishment of dominance — and sex-biased dominance — the study improves our understanding of the social impact of nepotism, political alliances, as well as emigration and immigration patterns in animal and human societies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Identifying how dominance within and between the sexes is established is pivotal to understanding sexual selection and sexual conflict. In many species, members of one sex dominate those of the other in one-on-one interactions. Whether this results from a disparity in intrinsic attributes, such as strength and aggressiveness, or in extrinsic factors, such as social support, is currently unknown. We assessed the effects of both mechanisms on dominance in the spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta), a species where sexual size dimorphism is low and females often dominate males. We found that individuals with greater potential social support dominated one-on-one interactions in all social contexts, irrespective of their body mass and sex. Female dominance emerged from a disparity in social support in favour of females. This disparity was a direct consequence of male-biased dispersal and the disruptive effect of dispersal on social bonds. Accordingly, the degree of female dominance varied with the demographic and kin structure of the social groups, ranging from male and female co-dominance to complete female dominance. Our study shows that social support can drive sex-biased dominance and provides empirical evidence that a sex-role-defining trait can emerge without the direct effect of sex.</p>

<p><em>social living simultaneously increases infection risk and decreases the cost of infection</em><br />
vanessa o. ezenwa et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2018.2142">http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2018.2142</a></p>

<p>Grant's gazelles that live in larger groups were more likely to be infected by intestinal worms, but less likely to suffer their ill effects than those in smaller groups.</p>
<p>&quot;The phenomenon of getting intestinal worm parasites is common to many, many species,&quot; said Vanessa Ezenwa, a professor in the Odum School of Ecology and College of Veterinary Medicine. &quot;And one of the strongest negative impacts of these types of infections, well described in domesticated animals, is that they cause anorexia. We find that in this wild species, being social somehow counteracts that effect.&quot;</p>
<p>Ezenwa conducted the study in Mpala Research Center in Kenya. Using nets deployed from a helicopter, her team captured wild gazelles. After tagging each one, they collected fecal samples and noted each animal's size, weight and other statistics. They treated half of the gazelles with a deworming drug that was effective for 120 days; the other half were left untreated as a control. The researchers then followed all of the animals for over a year, collecting fecal samples to monitor parasite levels and recording observations on the animals' social and feeding behavior.</p>
<p>They found that gazelles in larger groups -- groups of up to 25 individuals, with an average size of nine -- had a 39 percent higher risk of infection than those living in smaller groups.</p>
<p>But infected animals in these larger groups ate significantly more than infected animals in smaller groups -- almost as much as uninfected animals.</p>
<p>Ezenwa said that one reason the infected animals in larger groups may eat more is that the larger group offers more protection from predators.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a hypothesis called 'many eyes,'&quot; she said. &quot;When the group is bigger, the rate of detection of predators goes up, because at any given time there are more individuals paying attention. So that can free up individuals to put more time into other behaviors, and typically that would be feeding.&quot;</p>
<p>Ezenwa says that an important next step would be to conduct experiments under controlled conditions to explore the physiological and behavioral mechanisms driving the effect she observed.</p>
<p>Ezenwa also cautioned that the phenomenon of social living reducing the cost of infection may not be applicable to all parasites.</p>
<p>&quot;What I'm describing here might be particularly relevant for very common parasites you can't avoid over the course of your lifetime, but for rarer ones it might be a different story,&quot; she said. &quot;If you're going to be infected no matter what, like with these worms where the prevalence is really high and there's no way to protect yourself from them, then being in a big group might be an important way to minimize the impact of infection.&quot;</p>
<p>Ezenwa said that the results of the study show that it's important to think about both costs and benefits when trying to understand how social interactions shape infectious disease outcomes in individuals and populations.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a social species just like these gazelles,&quot; said Ezenwa. &quot;Being social has a lot of implications for our health. We already know that social contact has a huge impact on our exposure to infectious diseases, so I think what we need to understand better is how social contact might simultaneously give us advantages in terms of reducing the impacts of those infectious diseases.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Elevated parasite infection risk is considered to be a near-universal cost of social living. However, living in groups may also provide benefits that reduce the negative impacts of infection. These potential ‘tolerance’ benefits of living socially are theoretically possible, but have rarely been described. In this study, we used an anthelmintic treatment experiment in wild Grant's gazelles (Nanger granti), who are commonly infected with gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN), to show that social living confers both costs and benefits related to GIN parasitism. We show that although larger group size increases GIN infection risk, a key cost of GIN infection—the suppression of food intake—is simultaneously moderated by living in larger groups. Our findings help illuminate the complex role parasites play in the evolution of host social behaviour.</p>

<p><em>prior shared success predicts victory in team competitions</em><br />

<p>&quot;There's a general sense in sports about the importance of 'team chemistry,' but it's a nebulous concept,&quot; Contractor said. &quot;We wanted to be more rigorous about how we think about team chemistry. Psychology has shown that when you enjoy success together, you learn more from the experience, so we focused on players who played together on winning teams.&quot;</p>
<p>The researchers studied individual player statistics from five data sets: NBA games and English Premier League (EPL) soccer matches played between 2002-2013, Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches from 2008-2012, and Major League Baseball (MLB) games from 2002-2012. The group also studied 2011 game logs for Defense of the Ancients 2 (Dota 2), a multiplayer, team-based online battle game.</p>
<p>For each sport, researchers determined a team's overall skill -- the strength of their individual player attributes -- by calculating player averages in key statistical categories, like points per game and assists per game in basketball, or goals per game and shots on goals in soccer. They also measured the number of times a pair of players were part of the same winning team, a metric they called &quot;prior shared success.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to accounting for each team member's individual skills, researchers measured repeated interactions among players, with the thickness of a link being proportional to successful interactions.</p>
<p>The group used linear regression modeling to examine the impact of a team's past success on predicting the outcome of games during the season following each league's data set. They found marked improvement across each sport when prior shared success was included with the team's overall skill compared to accounting for team skills alone. The rate of correctly predicted games increased between 2 and 7 percent for the 2014 NBA and EPL seasons, the 2013 IPL and MLB seasons, and December 2011 virtual matches in Dota 2.</p>
<p>&quot;We looked at the results and thought, 'Is this too good to be true?'&quot; added Contractor, who is also a professor of communication studies in the School of Communication, and professor of management and organizations at Kellogg. &quot;We even tested the robustness of the findings by using alternative measures of individual player statistics used to compute skills variables, and the results held up.&quot;</p>
<p>The outcome was surprising, according to Contractor, considering the unique cultural differences between the sports that were studied. Baseball, for example, is driven by an &quot;ethos of three&quot; -- three strikes before a player is out, three outs before an inning ends. Although the standard is unique to this iconic American sport, the same patterns held true.</p>
<p>&quot;You would think that differences that are more culturally constrained impact one-on-one team dynamics, but to find that they don't, that our results transcend games and cultures -- including a global enterprise like Dota 2 -- is notable,&quot; Contractor said. &quot;To me, it's an illuminating and robust insight into what happens in teams.&quot;</p>
<p>Moving Beyond Sports</p>
<p>While the public availability of sports analytics made it a natural industry to test, the insights gained from the team's research applies to far more contexts, including business, academia -- and space travel. Contractor is currently working with NASA to study space crew simulations in hopes of better predicting the right combination of astronauts to maximize the crew's performance and viability when they are sent to Mars.</p>
<p>&quot;Once you've gained as much as you can from bringing the right people together, you have to look for the next competitive advantage,&quot; Contractor said. &quot;Whether it's in the workplace of the future on Earth or in deep space, understanding the relational predictors of team success is going to be very important.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Debate over the impact of team composition on the outcome of a contest has attracted sports enthusiasts and sports scientists for years. A commonly held belief regarding team success is the superstar effect; that is, including more talent improves the performance of a team1. However, studies of team sports have suggested that previous relations and shared experiences among team members improve the mutual understanding of individual habits, techniques and abilities and therefore enhance team coordination and strategy2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. We explored the impact of within-team relationships on the outcome of competition between sports teams. Relations among teammates consist of two aspects: qualitative and quantitative. While quantitative aspects measure the number of times two teammates collaborated, qualitative aspects focus on ‘prior shared success’; that is, whether teamwork succeeded or failed. We examined the association between qualitative team interactions and the probability of winning using historical records from professional sports—basketball in the National Basketball Association, football in the English Premier League, cricket in the Indian Premier League and baseball in Major League Baseball—and the multiplayer online battle game Defense of the Ancients 2. Our results show that prior shared success between team members significantly improves the odds of the team winning in all sports beyond the talents of individuals.</p>

<p>40 participating couples tried to complete an intentionally challenging task on a computer. Some of the couples were randomly assigned to work alone. The others got to sit near their spouse and hold their hand. While they worked, an infrared camera continuously measured pupil diameter, which is a direct signal of the body's physiological stress response.a close-up view of a human eye</p>
<p>&quot;The neat thing is that the pupils respond within 200 milliseconds to the onset of a stressor,&quot; said Steven Luke, a study co-author and psychology professor at BYU. &quot;It can immediately measure how someone responds to stress and whether having social support can change that. It's not just a different technique, it's a different time scale.&quot;</p>
<p>The experiment initially stressed out participants in both groups. But the spouse support group calmed down significantly sooner, allowing them to work on the task at reduced stress levels.</p>
<p>Measuring health benefits from social connection in real-time is quite rare. It's also one reason the research is published in the highly-ranked scientific journal PLOS One.</p>
<p>This study builds upon landmark research at BYU showing that relationships help people live longer.</p>
<p>&quot;When we have a spouse next to us and with us, it really helps us navigate and get through the stress we have to deal with in life,&quot; Birmingham said.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Social relationships, particularly marriage, have been shown to ameliorate the potentially pathogenic impact of stressful events but prior research has been mostly aimed at downstream effects, with less research on real-time reactivity. Pupillometry is an innovative procedure that allows us to see the effects of acute stress in real time. The muscles that control pupil size are linked to the autonomic nervous system, so that when stressed, the pupils dilate; this occurs within 200ms. This quick response allows us to see the immediate effects of acute stress on the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and the real-time effects of social support in buffering stress.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to examine the dampening effects of received social support on the ANS’s pupillary response.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Eighty individuals (40 couples) were randomly assigned to either a spousal support (i.e., spouse hand-holding) or non-support condition (i.e., alone) and administered a Stroop task while pupil dilation was measured.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>The Stroop task elicited a stress reaction in terms of pupil dilation in response to the incongruent task trials. Participants in the support condition showed accelerated habituation to the stress task (p &lt; .001), and less pupil reactivity (p &lt; .001) providing evidence for buffering effects of social support via spousal presence and hand-holding.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>These results reveal the speed at which stress-buffering occurs, suggesting that pupillometry could be a good method to address the immediate dampening effects of social support.</p>

<p><em>social and physiological context can affect the meaning of physiological synchrony</em><br />
chad danyluck, elizabeth page-gould 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-44667-5">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-44667-5</a></p>
<p>assumes similarity is criterion</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;In a variety of situations, people appear more social with one another when their autonomic nervous systems are in sync. However, this is the first study to show that, although people display physiological synchrony across social contexts, how much arousal people share can vary, differentially impacting social outcomes like perceived similarity and friendship interest,&quot; said Chad Danyluck, PhD, postdoctoral fellow at the Colorado School of Public Health.</p>
<p>Danyluck adds, &quot;Physiological synchrony has been found in a variety of relationships and environments, from married couples arguing to military units and sports teams coordinating their behaviors. Understanding whether and how shared arousal brings people together may help us hone the development of programs targeting team leadership and social cohesion in work environments. I am particularly interested in the role of physiological synchrony in fostering friendship interest across ethnic and racial divides.&quot;</p>
<p>Consistent with prior work, this study observed physiological synchrony in both branches of the autonomic nervous system and across cooperative and competitive social contexts. The authors general interest in physiological synchrony is in how synchrony during social interactions relates to social processes that ultimately lead to friendship.</p>
<p>The study found that different social contexts caused different levels of physiological arousal, meaning that the branches of the autonomic nervous system became either more or less reactive in response to the experimental task. However, in every condition, strangers quickly went &quot;in sync&quot; and did so in each branch of the autonomic nervous system whether they were high or low in arousal. Whether the social or physiological context of synchrony contributed to social outcomes, however, depended on which branch of the autonomic nervous system displayed synchrony.</p>
<p>The findings show that sharing similar amounts of sympathetic arousal was sufficient to increase perceptions of similarity -- a precursor to friendship -- regardless of social context and no matter the arousal levels partners shared. One possible explanation for this finding is that patterns of sympathetic arousal may correlate with observable body movements (and by extension a lack of arousal may correlate with a lack of body movement) that might predict perceived similarity if shared among partners. By comparison, people for whom parasympathetic synchrony and parasympathetic reactivity was high generally reported more friendship interest when the social context permitted conversation than when it did not. In other words, when parasympathetic activity increased during a social interaction, parasympathetic synchrony only mattered for the development of friendship between strangers who could converse.</p>
<p>Using data from 134 strangers interacting in pairs, the researchers manipulated two features of social context to test their impact on synchrony in sympathetic and parasympathetic reactivity. Participants completed a knot-tying task within a collective reward (&quot;cooperation&quot;) or individual reward (&quot;competition&quot;) framework while conversing or not (&quot;talking&quot; condition). Autonomic reactivity varied by features of social context. Synchrony occurred across social contexts in both autonomic branches. The researchers then examined how synchrony predicted affiliation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Survival of many species, from insects and birds to human and non-human mammals, requires synchronized activity. Among humans, synchrony occurs even at the level of autonomic functioning; people interacting often show mutual, simultaneous changes in activity of the sympathetic or parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. Critically, autonomic reactivity predicts many mental states and, when synchronized, may reflect higher-order social processes like affiliation. Here, using data from 134 strangers interacting in pairs, we manipulated two features of social context to test their impact on synchrony in sympathetic and parasympathetic reactivity. Participants completed a knot-tying task within a collective reward (“cooperation”) or individual reward (“competition”) framework while conversing or not (“talking” condition). Autonomic reactivity varied by features of social context. Synchrony occurred across social contexts in both autonomic branches. We then examined how synchrony predicted affiliation. Sympathetic synchrony alone predicted affiliation yet social context and parasympathetic reactivity moderated associations between parasympathetic synchrony and affiliation. Thus, social and physiological context of parasympathetic synchrony predicted affiliation better than parasympathetic synchrony alone. We argue that social context and the degree of physiological reactivity underlying physiological synchrony, not the mere existence of physiological synchrony, are key to interpreting physiological synchrony as a social process.</p>

<p><em>children delay gratification for cooperative ends</em><br />
rebecca koomen et al. 2020<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797619894205">http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797619894205</a></p>

<p>a modified version of the “marshmallow test,” a classic psychological experiment designed to examine young children’s ability to delay gratification. In the classic experiment, preschool children were led into a room where a marshmallow or other treat was placed on a table. The children were told they could either eat the treat right away, or they could wait until the experimenter, who had to step out of the room, returned, in which case they’d receive a second treat. About a third of the children were able to wait for the second treat for up to 15 minutes.<br />
In their new research, the researchers paired up more than 200 5- and 6-year-olds and had them play a brief balloon toss game to get comfortable in the testing environment. They then put the partners in separate rooms and placed a cookie in front of each of them. Some partners were assigned to a solo condition and only had to rely on their own self-control to earn a second cookie, much like the traditional experiment. Others were placed in a cooperative condition in which they received a second treat only if both they and their partner waited until the experimenter returned. Waiting in this condition was therefore risky and indeed less likely to result in a second cookie because children had to rely both on themselves and their partner to refrain from eating. The authors called this the interdependence condition. To identify any cultural differences in the responses, the researchers tested children at a laboratory in Germany and went to schools in Kenya to test children of the Kikuyu tribe.<br />
Across both conditions, Kikuyu children were more likely to delay gratification compared to their German counterparts. But across the two cultures, significantly more children held off on eating the first cookie in the interdependence condition compared with the solo condition.<br />
“The fact that we obtained these findings even though children could not see or communicate with each other attests to the strong motivational consequences that simply being in a cooperative context has for children from early on in development,” Grueneisen said.<br />
The research team suggest that children from a young age develop a sense of obligation towards their social partners.<br />
“In this study, children may have been motivated to delay gratification because they felt they shouldn’t let their partner down,” Koomen said, “and that if they did, their partner would have had the right to hold them accountable.”</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> To cooperate effectively, both in small-scale interactions and large-scale collective-action problems, people frequently have to delay gratification (i.e., resist short-term temptations in favor of joint long-term goals). Although delay-of-gratification skills are commonly considered critical in children’s social-cognitive development, they have rarely been studied in the context of cooperative decision-making. In the current study, we therefore presented pairs of children (<em>N</em> = 207 individuals) with a modified version of the famous marshmallow test, in which children’s outcomes were interdependently linked such that the children were rewarded only if both members of the pair delayed gratification. Children from two highly diverse cultures (Germany and Kenya) performed substantially better than they did on a standard version of the test, suggesting that children are more willing to delay gratification for cooperative than for individual goals. The results indicate that from early in life, human children are psychologically equipped to respond to social interdependencies in ways that facilitate cooperative success.</p>

<p><em>does whom you know in the status hierarchy prevent or trigger health limitation? institutional embeddedness of social capital and social cost theories in three societies</em><br />

<p>Does whom you know in the status hierarchy prevent or trigger health limitation (life disruption due to health problems)? Does that effect vary by society? To addresses these two questions, this study applies five theories and analyzes nationally representative data from three societies (the United States, urban China, and Taiwan). Social capital theory expects accessed status (network members’ status) to prevent health limitation, while social cost theory as proposed here asserts the opposite. The collectivistic advantage explanation anticipates social capital theory to apply more to urban China and Taiwan but social cost theory to apply more to the United States, while the collectivistic disadvantage explanation predicts the opposite. The inequality structure explanation expects social capital theory to apply more to Taiwan and social cost theory to apply more to the United States and urban China. This study measures accessed status on the occupational dimension. Results support social capital theory in Taiwan, social cost theory in the other two societies, and the inequality structure explanation across the three societies.</p>

<p>when you’re down / and troubled / and you need some loving care<br />
and nothing / whoa /nothing is going right<br />
close your eyes / and think of me / and soon i will be there<br />
to brighten up / even your darkest nights</p>
<p>☆you just call out my name / and you know wherever i am<br />
　i’ll come running / to see you again<br />
　winter, spring, summer, or fall / all you have to do is call<br />
　and i’ll be there, yes i will<br />
　you’ve got a friend</p>
<p>if the sky / up above you / should turn dark and full of clouds<br />
and that old / north wind / should begin to blow<br />
keep your head together / and call my name out loud<br />
soon you’ll hear me knocking / on your door</p>
<p>☆repeat</p>
<p>hey, ain’t it good to know / that you’ve got a friend?<br />
when people / can be so cold<br />
they’ll hurt you / and desert you<br />
and take your soul if you let them<br />
but don’t you let them</p>

<li>lots of random inputs from lots of random people in the past few days. not entirely unwelcome, but unsettling nonetheless. started thinking about how few, if any people i can rely on — but remembering that is a good thing, as living under illusion that it is otherwise for anybody, even the most cooperative of us, is a recipe for eventual disaster. what they don’t understand is that acknowledging this does not equate with despair — it is not shattering to no longer depend on an illusion for our wellbeing, indeed that wellbeing itself is a myth that traps us. i still love my friends and family, even if it is maybe less (or maybe just different–) illusory than most examples of such love.</li>

<li>it turns out that it is often your friends who are the problem for righteous people. by supporting you in your righteousness, they encourage your extremism, instead of mitigating it, thus damaging your ability to maintain real relationships. sometimes they will repent, long after the damage is sadly irreversible.</li>

<li>even when communicating with our closest friends, many of us are trained to assume worse than we should — rather, for those of us who are lucky enough not to have been trained this way, relationships are more adaptable and can flourish more easily than for most people.</li>
<li>but in today's society this is rare, and symmetric friendships of this type are even more rare, for that same reason. right now, few people are fortunate enough to be in circumstances where they can to wholeheartedly trust another, but it doesn't have to be that way forever.</li>
