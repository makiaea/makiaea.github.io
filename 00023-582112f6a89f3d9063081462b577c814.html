<p><em>now you see it: our brains predict the outcomes of our actions, shaping reality into what we expect. that’s why we see what we believe</em><br />

<li>schizophrenic patients and healthy control volunteers were shown video feedback of their actions that could be altered in various ways – such as spatially distorting the footage or adding temporal delays. The researchers found that the patients were poorer at detecting these mismatches, suggesting that they had a relatively impoverished perception of their own actions.<br />
This deficit in action monitoring and concomitant delusions could arise because these patients experience a breakdown in the mechanisms that allow them to predict the consequences of their movements. These could lead to a change in how action outcomes are experienced, which in turn predisposes the patients to develop bizarre beliefs. In particular, losing the ‘sharpening’ benefits of top-down prediction might leave people with relatively more ambiguous experiences of their actions, making it hard to determine what has or has not happened as a result of their behaviour. While this ambiguity might be acutely distressing in its own right, being afflicted by such unusual experiences for a prolonged time could contribute to an individual’s ‘delusional mood’ – the sense that strange things are happening that require a strange, and perhaps delusional, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2536">explanation</a>.</li>

<p><em>implicit pattern learning predicts individual differences in belief in god in the united states and afghanistan</em><br />
adam b. weinberger et al. 2020<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18362-3">doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18362-3</a></p>

<p>Our hypothesis is that people whose brains are good at subconsciously discerning patterns in their environment may ascribe those patterns to the hand of a higher power,&quot; he adds.<br />
&quot;A really interesting observation was what happened between childhood and adulthood,&quot; explains Green. The data suggest that if children are unconsciously picking up on patterns in the environment, their belief is more likely to increase as they grow up, even if they are in a nonreligious household. Likewise, if they are not unconsciously picking up on patterns around them, their belief is more likely to decrease as they grow up, even in a religious household.<br />
The study used a well-established cognitive test to measure implicit pattern learning. Participants watched as a sequence of dots appeared and disappeared on a computer screen. They pressed a button for each dot. The dots moved quickly, but some participants -- the ones with the strongest implicit learning ability -- began to subconsciously learn patterns hidden in the sequence, and even press the correct button for the next dot before that dot actually appeared. However, even the best implicit learners did not know that the dots formed patterns, showing that the learning was happening at an unconscious level.<br />
The U.S. section of the study enrolled a predominantly Christian group of 199 participants from Washington, D.C. The Afghanistan section of the study enrolled a group of 149 Muslim participants in Kabul. The study's lead author was Adam Weinberger, a postdoctoral researcher in Green's lab at Georgetown and at the University of Pennsylvania. Co-authors Zachery Warren and Fathali Moghaddam led a team of local Afghan researchers who collected data in Kabul.<br />
&quot;The most interesting aspect of this study, for me, and also for the Afghan research team, was seeing patterns in cognitive processes and beliefs replicated across these two cultures,&quot; says Warren. &quot;Afghans and Americans may be more alike than different, at least in certain cognitive processes involved in religious belief and making meaning of the world around us. Irrespective of one's faith, the findings suggest exciting insights into the nature of belief.&quot;<br />
&quot;A brain that is more predisposed to implicit pattern learning may be more inclined to believe in a god no matter where in the world that brain happens to find itself, or in which religious context,&quot; Green adds, though he cautions that further research is necessary.<br />
&quot;Optimistically,&quot; Green concludes, &quot;this evidence might provide some neuro-cognitive common ground at a basic human level between believers of disparate faiths.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Most humans believe in a god, but many do not. Differences in belief have profound societal impacts. Anthropological accounts implicate bottom-up perceptual processes in shaping religious belief, suggesting that individual differences in these processes may help explain variation in belief. Here, in findings replicated across socio-religiously disparate samples studied in the U.S. and Afghanistan, implicit learning of patterns/order within visuospatial sequences (IL-pat) in a strongly bottom-up paradigm predict 1) stronger belief in an intervening/ordering god, and 2) increased strength-of-belief from childhood to adulthood, controlling for explicit learning and parental belief. Consistent with research implicating IL-pat as a basis of intuition, and intuition as a basis of belief, mediation models support a hypothesized effect pathway whereby IL-pat leads to intuitions of order which, in turn, lead to belief in ordering gods. The universality and variability of human IL-pat may thus contribute to the global presence and variability of religious belief.</p>

<p><em>belief in own worth</em><br />
we are often exhorted to be confident our courageous, but these qualities come from belief in our own abilities and our capacity to deal with things. that is why these traits are good or attractive, because they show our capabilities. it also follows that if we wish to be truly confident or courageous then what we need to do is learn, reflect on, and build our capabilities.</p>

<li>faith and doubt belong together, allows renewal, hope. faiths without doubts are tyrannies. doubts without faith is despair.</li>
<li>illusion of being right, illusion that there is a right answer — leads to inability to learn
<ul>
<li>what is odd about people who worship statistics is that they intellectually know they could be wrong, but because the probability of that seems low to them, their belief allows them to stop questioning their faith.</li>
</ul>

<li>doubt is a positive thing, unlike what they say. when you can imagine even a small event happening differently to how you were told, your world becomes richer, not poorer. especially when people are trying to manipulate you, this is one of the few practical ways to defend against their manipulation. because when even something very small is not what they say it is, your understanding and interpretation and appreciation of something or an event or an action can be completely different to that it would be without that little reinterpretation.</li>

<li>believing in something is different from having blind faith in it. we can believe the scientific method is good without believing in everything purporting to be science. we can believe in god without believing in everything purporting to be religion.</li>
