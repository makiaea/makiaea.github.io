<p><em>the complexity of understanding others as the evolutionary origin of empathy and emotional contagion</em><br />
fabrizio mafessoni, michael lachmann 2019<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41835-5">doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41835-5</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>standard theoretical models of the origins of empathy tend to focus on scenarios in which coordination or cooperation are favored.</p>
<p>Mafessoni, and his co-author Michael Lachmann, a theoretical biologist and Professor at the Santa Fe Institute, explored the possibility that the cognitive processes underlying a broad range of empathetic responses -- including emotional contagion, contagious yawning, and pathologies like echopraxia (compulsive repetition of others' movements) and echolalia (compulsive repetition of others' speech) -- could evolve in the absence of kin selection or any other mechanism directly favoring cooperation or coordination.</p>
<p>Mafessoni and Lachmann posited that animals, including humans, can engage in the act of simulating the minds of others. We cannot read other minds -- they are like black boxes to us. But, as Lachmann explains, all agents share almost identical &quot;black boxes&quot; with members of their species, and &quot;they are constantly running simulations of what other minds might be doing.&quot; This ongoing as-actor simulation is not necessarily geared toward cooperation: it's just something humans and animals do spontaneously.</p>
<p>An example of this process is represented by mirror neurons: it has been known for some time that the same neurons engaged in planning a hand movement are also used when observing the hand movement of others. Mafessoni and Lachmann wondered what the consequences would be if they were to extend that process of understanding to any social interaction.</p>
<p>When they modeled outcomes rooted in cognitive simulation, they found that actors engaged in as-actor simulation produce a variety of systems typically explained in terms of cooperation or kin-selection. They also found that an observer can occasionally coordinate with an actor even when this outcome is not advantageous. Their model suggests that empathetic systems do not evolve solely because agents are disposed to cooperation and kin-selection. They also evolve because animals simulate others to envision their actions. According to Mafessoni, &quot;the very origin of empathy may lie in the need to understand other individuals.&quot;</p>
<p>For Lachmann, their findings &quot;completely change how we think about humans and animals.&quot; Their model is grounded in a single, cognitive mechanism that unifies a broad set of phenomena under one explanation. It therefore has theoretical import for a wide range of fields, including cognitive psychology, anthropology, neuroscience, complex systems, and evolutionary biology. Its power stems from both its unifying clarity and its theoretical interest in the limits of cooperation as an explanatory frame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Contagious yawning, emotional contagion and empathy are characterized by the activation of similar neurophysiological states or responses in an observed individual and an observer. For example, it is hard to keep one’s mouth closed when imagining someone yawning, or not feeling distressed while observing other individuals perceiving pain. The evolutionary origin of these widespread phenomena is unclear, since a direct benefit is not always apparent. We explore a game theoretical model for the evolution of mind-reading strategies, used to predict and respond to others’ behavior. In particular we explore the evolutionary scenarios favoring simulative strategies, which recruit overlapping neural circuits when performing as well as when observing a specific behavior. We show that these mechanisms are advantageous in complex environments, by allowing an observer to use information about its own behavior to interpret that of others. However, without inhibition of the recruited neural circuits, the observer would perform the corresponding downstream action, rather than produce the appropriate social response. We identify evolutionary trade-offs that could hinder this inhibition, leading to emotional contagion as a by-product of mind-reading. The interaction of this model with kinship is complex. We show that empathy likely evolved in a scenario where kin- and other indirect benefits co-opt strategies originally evolved for mind-reading, and that this model explains observed patterns of emotional contagion with kin or group members.</p>

<p><em>evolution of empathetic moral evaluation</em><br />
arunas l radzvilavicius et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.7554/elife.44269">doi.org/10.7554/elife.44269</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How we form these moral assessments of others has a lot to do with cultural and social norms, as well as our capacity for empathy, the extent to which we can take on the perspective of another person.</p>
<p>In a new analysis, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania investigate cooperation with an evolutionary approach. Using game-theory-driven models, they show that a capacity for empathy fosters cooperation, according to senior author Joshua Plotkin, an evolutionary biologist. The models also show that the extent to which empathy promotes cooperation depends on a given society's system for moral evaluation.</p>
<p>&quot;Having not just the capacity but the willingness to take into account someone else's perspective when forming moral judgments tends to promote cooperation,&quot; says Plotkin.</p>
<p>What's more, the group's analysis points to a heartening conclusion. All else being equal, empathy tends to spread throughout a population under most scenarios.</p>
<p>&quot;We asked, 'can empathy evolve?'&quot; explains Arunas Radzvilavicius, the study's lead author and a postdoctoral researcher who works with Plotkin. &quot;What if individuals start copying the empathetic way of observing each other's interactions? And we saw that empathy soared through the population.&quot;</p>
<p>Plotkin and Radzvilavicius coauthored the study, published today in eLife, with Alexander Stewart, an assistant professor at the University of Houston.</p>
<p>Plenty of scientists have probed the question of why individuals cooperate through indirect reciprocity, a scenario in which one person helps another not because of a direct quid pro quo but because they know that person to be &quot;good.&quot; But the Penn group gave the study a nuance that others had not explored. Whereas other studies have assumed that reputations are universally known, Plotkin, Radzvilavicius, and Stewart realized this did not realistically describe human society, where individuals may differ in their opinion of others' reputations.</p>
<p>&quot;In large, modern societies, people disagree a lot about each other's moral reputations,&quot; Plotkin says.</p>
<p>The researchers incorporated this variation in opinions into their models, which imagine someone choosing either to donate or not to donate to a second person based on that individual's reputation. The researchers found that cooperation was less likely to be sustained when people disagree about each other's reputations.</p>
<p>That's when they decided to incorporate empathy, or theory of mind, which, in the context of the study, entails the ability to understand the perspective of another person.</p>
<p>Doing so allowed cooperation to win out over more selfish strategies.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes a lot of sense,&quot; Plotkin says. &quot;If I don't account for your point of view, there will be many occasions when I judge you harshly when I really shouldn't because, from your perspective, you were doing the right thing.&quot;</p>
<p>To further explore the impact of empathy on cooperation, the researchers looked at a variety of frameworks, or social norms, that people might use to assign a reputation to another person based on their behavior. For example, most frameworks label someone &quot;good&quot; if they reward a fellow &quot;good&quot; individual, but social norms differ in how they judge interactions with a person deemed bad. While the &quot;stern judging&quot; norm labels &quot;good&quot; anyone who punishes a bad actor, the &quot;simple standing&quot; norm does not require this punitive approach: A &quot;good&quot; person can reward a bad one.</p>
<p>Plotkin, Radzvilavicius, and Stewart discovered again that capacity for empathy mattered. When populations were empathetic, stern judging was the best at promoting cooperation. But when a group was less willing to take on the perspective of another, other norms maximized rates of cooperation.</p>
<p>This result prompted the team to ask another evolutionary question -- whether empathy itself can evolve and become stable in a population. And under most scenarios, the answer was yes.</p>
<p>&quot;Starting with a population where no one is empathetic, with people judging each other based on their own perspective, we saw that eventually individuals will copy the behavior of those who judge empathetically,&quot; says Plotkin. &quot;Empathy will spread, and cooperation can emerge.&quot;</p>
<p>This was the case even when the researchers accounted for a degree of errors, noise, and misperception in their models.</p>
<p>The findings open up a new area of research for both evolutionary theory and empirical studies into how societies behave.</p>
<p>&quot;Empathy is completely foreign to game theory,&quot; Radzvilavicius say. &quot;In a way this is finding a new niche for research to progress to in the future, accounting for theory of mind.&quot;</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the Penn team hopes to pursue such questions, perhaps by pitting different social norms against one another and eventually by testing their ideas against observations from real people, either through experiments they design or through data collected from social media.</p>
<p>&quot;It's obvious that in social media people are acutely aware of their public persona and reputation and curate it carefully,&quot; Plotkin says. &quot;It would be fascinating to analyze these evolutionary dynamics as they play out in online interactions.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Social norms can promote cooperation by assigning reputations to individuals based on their past actions. A good reputation indicates that an individual is likely to reciprocate. A large body of research has established norms of moral assessment that promote cooperation, assuming reputations are objective. But without a centralized institution to provide objective evaluation, opinions about an individual's reputation may differ across a population. In this setting we study the role of empathy-the capacity to form moral evaluations from another person's perspective. We show that empathy tends to foster cooperation by reducing the rate of unjustified defection. The norms of moral evaluation previously considered most socially beneficial depend on high levels of empathy, whereas different norms maximize social welfare in populations incapable of empathy. Finally, we show that empathy itself can evolve through social contagion. We conclude that a capacity for empathy is a key component for sustaining cooperation in societies.</p>

<ul>
<li>Realistically, you’re a lot more independent than you would be if you had a nice, cushy upbringing. You know what hard times look like, you know you’ve gotten through them, and that means you can be an actually helpful, beneficial friend to have when the going gets tough for your future friends, which not everyone has the perspective to be able to do.</li>
<li>You can think more critically and creatively because you’ve had to question societal norms your whole life. It’s a mindf*ck for a kid to not have their home be their safe space when that’s what they see on TV and in their classmates’ lives, but I can guarantee that you have a much more realistic view of the world than you would if you lived a life that was “The Norm.”</li>
<li>If you decide to let your proverbial guard down (which I highly recommend working toward), you’ll probably find that you can develop a really refined sense of empathy, because it will be much easier for you to identify with other people’s hardships due to your own experiences. It’s one thing to empathize with someone based on an imagined idea of what their circumstance is like, but if life has punched you in the face a few times, you’re not going to forget what a cosmic KO feels like.</li>

<p><em>disease dynamics in a stochastic network game: a little empathy goes a long way in averting outbreaks</em><br />
ceyhun eksin, jeff s. shamma, joshua s. weitz 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep44122">doi.org/10.1038/srep44122</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals change their behavior during an epidemic in response to whether they and/or those they interact with are healthy or sick. Healthy individuals may utilize protective measures to avoid contracting a disease. Sick individuals may utilize preemptive measures to avoid spreading a disease. Yet, in practice both protective and preemptive changes in behavior come with costs. This paper proposes a stochastic network disease game model that captures the self-interests of individuals during the spread of a susceptible-infected-susceptible disease. In this model, individuals strategically modify their behavior based on current disease conditions. These reactions influence disease spread. We show that there is a critical level of concern, i.e., empathy, by the sick individuals above which disease is eradicated rapidly. Furthermore, we find that risk averse behavior by the healthy individuals cannot eradicate the disease without the preemptive measures of the sick individuals. Empathy is more effective than risk-aversion because when infectious individuals change behavior, they reduce all of their potential infections, whereas when healthy individuals change behavior, they reduce only a small portion of potential infections. This imbalance in the role played by the response of the infected versus the susceptible individuals on disease eradication affords critical policy insights.</li>

<p><em>impact of violent crime on risk aversion: evidence from the mexican drug war</em><br />
ryan brown et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00788">doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00788</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the first study of its kind, researchers from the University of Colorado Denver used longitudinal survey data taken before and after the onset of the Mexican war on drugs to find a causal link between the fear of violence and its impact on the risk-taking attitudes of individuals living in affected communities.</p>
<p>Previous research on risk preferences has relied on data gathered only after a violent event, and found insecure environments made residents either more risk tolerant or had no effect at all.</p>
<p>But this new study, &quot;Impact of Violent Crime on Risk Aversion: Evidence from the Mexican Drug War,&quot; published in the Review of Economics and Statistics, found the opposite is true. By also using data collected before the rise in crime, it found that fear had a profound effect on the residents, leading them to express more cautious attitudes toward risk. This change has the potential to have a widespread and long-lasting impact on the economy, as risk tolerance is associated with opening a business, investing in education and migrating to greater opportunities.</p>
<p>&quot;We wondered if risk attitudes determined the environment in which someone lives, or if the environment determined their risk attitudes,&quot; said Ryan Brown, assistant professor of economics in CU Denver's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. &quot;When you're only looking at people after an event, some have moved away, others stop answering their door or won't fill out your survey. This was our chance to study people before and after an event that caught everyone unaware. If you don't look across time to see the whole picture, you're going to miss a lot of that.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown and his team found the whole picture in the Mexican Family Life Survey, a longitudinal survey of more than 35,000 people living in more than 8,400 households in 16 states across the country. The initial survey, conducted in 2002, explored how people's economic behavior changed over time. To assess risk attitudes, the survey asked respondents to choose between hypothetical gambles with different payoffs, in which options that offered a higher expected payoff also involved greater risk.</p>
<p>The first follow-up was conducted from 2005 to 2006, a time of relatively stable levels of violent crime. The second follow-up was conducted after a major escalation in violence, from 2009 to 2012, shortly after President Felipe Calderón declared a war on drugs in 2006. The policy change splintered cartels, and homicide rates across the country soared. As a result, some communities that were never exposed to drug violence were overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The researchers discovered that an increase of one homicide per 10,000 people increased the likelihood of being in the longitudinal study's most risk-averse category by 5 percent. Uniquely, the researchers provided evidence that this relationship was predominately caused by an increase in feelings of fear.</p>
<p>&quot;We understood why being in an insecure environment would change your risk preferences, but until now, we didn't know the mechanisms behind it,&quot; said Brown. &quot;This study allows us to rule out the policy mechanism; that improving access to health care, the economic environment or mental health will make a difference.</p>
<p>Instead, we're left with a much more difficult question: How do you fix fear?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Whereas attitudes towards risk play an important role in many decisions over the life-course, factors that affect those attitudes are not fully understood. Using longitudinal survey data collected in Mexico before and during the Mexican war on drugs, we investigate how risk attitudes change with variation in insecurity and uncertainty brought on by unprecedented changes in local-area violent crime. Exploiting the fact that the timing, virulence and spatial distribution of changes in violent crime were unanticipated, we establish there is a rise in risk aversion spread across the entire local population as local-area violent crime increases.</p>

<p><em>from painkiller to empathy killer: acetaminophen (paracetamol) reduces empathy for pain</em><br />

<ul>
<li>“Simulation theories of empathy hypothesize that empathizing with others’ pain shares some common psychological computations with the processing of one’s own pain. Support for this perspective has largely relied on functional neuroimaging evidence of an overlap between activations during the experience of physical pain and empathy for other people’s pain. Here, we extend the functional overlap perspective to the neurochemical level and test whether a common physical painkiller, acetaminophen (paracetamol), can reduce empathy for another’s pain. In two double-blind placebo-controlled experiments, participants rated perceived pain, personal distress and empathic concern in response to reading scenarios about another’s physical or social pain, witnessing ostracism in the lab, or visualizing another study participant receiving painful noise blasts. As hypothesized, acetaminophen reduced empathy in response to others’ pain. Acetaminophen also reduced the unpleasantness of noise blasts delivered to the participant, which mediated acetaminophen’s effects on empathy. Together, these findings suggest that the physical painkiller acetaminophen reduces empathy for pain and provide a new perspective on the neurochemical bases of empathy. Because empathy regulates prosocial and antisocial behavior, these drug-induced reductions in empathy raise concerns about the broader social side effects of acetaminophen, which is taken by almost a quarter of adults in the United States each week.”</li>
<li>“A variant of this approach was recently used to show that placebo analgesia reduces empathy for others, an effect mediated by the opioid system (Rütgen et al., 2015a,b).”</li>
<li>“In summary, our research is the first to show that the popular physical painkiller acetaminophen can reduce empathy to the pain of others. Physical pain is an aversive experience, and un- doubtedly many people can attest to acetaminophen’s benefi- cial ability to suppress physical pain. However, acetaminophen can also have unappreciated psychosocial side effects by inter- rupting the fundamental capacity to empathically connect with other people’s painful experiences. Quite literally, acetamino- phen reduces one’s ability to feel another’s pain.”</li>

<p><em>the role of touch in regulating inter-partner physiological coupling during empathy for pain</em><br />

<ul>
<li>The human ability to synchronize with other individuals is critical for the development of social behavior. Recent research has shown that physiological inter-personal synchronization may underlie behavioral synchrony. Nevertheless, the factors that modulate physiological coupling are still largely unknown. Here we suggest that social touch and empathy for pain may enhance interpersonal physiological coupling. Twenty-two romantic couples were assigned the roles of target (pain receiver) and observer (pain observer) under pain/no-pain and touch/no-touch conditions, and their ECG and respiration rates were recorded. The results indicate that the partner touch increased interpersonal respiration coupling under both pain and no-pain conditions and increased heart rate coupling under pain conditions. In addition, physiological coupling was diminished by pain in the absence of the partner’s touch. Critically, we found that high partner’s empathy and high levels of analgesia enhanced coupling during the partner’s touch. Collectively, the evidence indicates that social touch increases interpersonal physiological coupling during pain. Furthermore, the effects of touch on cardio-respiratory inter-partner coupling may contribute to the analgesic effects of touch via the autonomic nervous system.</li>

<p><em>political issues, evidence, and citizen engagement: the case of unequal access to affordable health care</em><br />

<li>
<p>what makes people care about social and economic problems they may not necessarily face in their daily lives, and whether that concern is a function of how the problems are described.</p>
<p>The team looked at several types of evidence showing that a problem exists. For example, statistics can describe the magnitude of the problem or they can be phrased in percentage terms -- such as the percentage of people facing a problem. They designed a series of studies to test which type of evidence increased people's engagement, either by making a donation, paying attention to an email or stating a concern.</p>
<p>The research was conducted in collaboration with a nonprofit in Ithaca, New York, that strives to increase access to affordable health care, including funding for a free clinic.</p>
<p>In the studies, likely new donors received solicitations by mail, members of the organization received a solicitation email, and study participants unaffiliated with the organization took a survey gauging their interest in access to affordable health care.</p>
<p>The messaging used in solicitations included combinations of high percentages, low percentages, case studies and raw numbers to describe the magnitude of the uninsured who can't afford health care.</p>
<p>For example, the potential donors received either a standard letter, one saying 57 percent of uninsured people couldn't afford the care they need, or one describing how a real uninsured person benefited from the nonprofit's services.</p>
<p>Across the board, the percentage-based evidence and human interest evidence tended to drive engagement, but talking about the overall magnitude of the problem didn't.</p>
<p>&quot;When you talk about the millions of children who are starving, or the millions of refugees who are seeking out a better life, it fails to have this emotional connection that tends to then motivate people to pay more attention and to become engaged,&quot; Levine said.</p>
<p>The study offers a model of what a meaningful collaboration between researchers and practitioners can look like.</p>
<p>&quot;Pull at people's emotional heartstrings,&quot; Levine said. &quot;You can do it with certain forms of statistical evidence. You can do it with sympathetic case studies. And that will move behavior and move attitudes.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Some social and economic problems do not gain broad awareness. Yet others become prominent (and perhaps are alleviated) in part because they successfully engage the wider citizenry. In this paper, we investigate how the evidence used to describe problems affects public engagement. Using disparities in access to affordable health care—a focal aspect of economic inequality in the United States—as our main issue, we conduct a series of field and survey experiments showing how some forms of evidence reduce attitudinal and behavioral engagement while other forms increase them. Our results challenge common arguments about political communication and behavior, while also shedding new light on a central question in the study of politics: What determines when citizens become concerned about a social problem?</p>

<p><em>the psychological health benefits of accepting negative emotions and thoughts: laboratory, diary, and longitudinal evidence</em><br />
brett q. ford et al. 2017<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspp0000157">doi.org/10.1037/pspp0000157</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals differ in the degree to which they tend to habitually accept their emotions and thoughts without judging them—a process here referred to as habitual acceptance. Acceptance has been linked with greater psychological health, which we propose may be due to the role acceptance plays in negative emotional responses to stressors: acceptance helps keep individuals from reacting to—and thus exacerbating—their negative mental experiences. Over time, experiencing lower negative emotion should promote psychological health. To test these hypotheses, Study 1 (N = 1,003) verified that habitually accepting mental experiences broadly predicted psychological health (psychological well-being, life satisfaction, and depressive and anxiety symptoms), even when controlling for potentially related constructs (reappraisal, rumination, and other mindfulness facets including observing, describing, acting with awareness, and nonreactivity). Next, in a laboratory study (Study 2, N = 156), habitual acceptance predicted lower negative (but not positive) emotional responses to a standardized stressor. Finally, in a longitudinal design (Study 3, N = 222), acceptance predicted lower negative (but not positive) emotion experienced during daily stressors that, in turn, accounted for the link between acceptance and psychological health 6 months later. This link between acceptance and psychological health was unique to accepting mental experiences and was not observed for accepting situations. Additionally, we ruled out potential confounding effects of gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and life stress severity. Overall, these results suggest that individuals who accept rather than judge their mental experiences may attain better psychological health, in part because acceptance helps them experience less negative emotion in response to stressors.</li>

<ul>
<li>Many people feel emotional when hungry—or “hangry”—yet little research explores the psychological mechanisms underlying such states. Guided by psychological constructionist and affect misattribution theories, we propose that hunger alone is insufficient for feeling hangry. Rather, we hypothesize that people experience hunger as emotional when they conceptualize their affective state as negative, high arousal emotions specifically in a negative context. Studies 1 and 2 use a cognitive measure (the affect misattribution procedure; Payne, Hall, Cameron, &amp; Bishara, 2010) to demonstrate that hunger shifts affective perceptions in negative but not neutral or positive contexts. Study 3 uses a laboratory-based experiment to demonstrate that hunger causes individuals to experience negative emotions and to negatively judge a researcher, but only when participants are not aware that they are conceptualizing their affective state as emotions. Implications for emotion theory, health, and embodied contributions to perception are discussed.</li>

<p><em>associations of child emotion recognition with interparental conflict and shy child temperament traits</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Severe early adversity, such as maltreatment and neglect, has been associated with alterations in children’s recognition of emotion. We sought to build on such findings by testing whether children’s exposure to interparental conflict, a much less severe form of adversity, is also associated with children’s emotion recognition. Further, we sought to examine the role of temperamental shyness in these associations. We presented 99 9- to 11-year-olds (56 males) with photographs of actors posing as a couple portraying interpersonal anger, happiness, and neutrality, and children classified the emotions in the photos. Children reported on interparental conflict, and their mothers reported on children’s shyness. Children’s perceptions of threat regarding interparental conflict interacted with trial type (angry, happy, neutral) to predict accuracy; greater threat perceptions predicted less accuracy for neutral expressions, a relatively ambiguous stimulus type. Additionally, shyness interacted with children’s threat perceptions. At low levels of shyness, low levels of threat perceptions predicted high accuracy, whereas high threat, high shyness, and their combination predicted poorer accuracy. Results suggest the significance of interparental conflict in altering children’s emotion recognition and of shyness in strengthening such adaptations. These findings suggest that even forms of adversity that are less severe than maltreatment and neglect have substantial implications for emotion processing, particularly for children with shy traits.</li>

<ul>
<li>Stress can trigger enduring changes in neural circuits and synapses. The behavioral and hormonal consequences of stress can also be transmitted to others, but whether this transmitted stress has similar effects on synapses is not known. We found that authentic stress and transmitted stress in mice primed paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons, enabling the induction of metaplasticity at glutamate synapses. In female mice that were subjected to authentic stress, this metaplasticity was diminished following interactions with a naive partner. Transmission from the stressed subject to the naive partner required the activation of PVN CRH neurons in both subject and partner to drive and detect the release of a putative alarm pheromone from the stressed mouse. Finally, metaplasticity could be transmitted sequentially from the stressed subject to multiple partners. Our findings demonstrate that transmitted stress has the same lasting effects on glutamate synapses as authentic stress and reveal an unexpected role for PVN CRH neurons in transmitting distress signals among individuals.</li>

<ul>
<li><em>abstract</em> Gratitude has been linked to behaviors involving the exchange of resources; it motivates people to repay debts to benefactors. However, given its links to self-control—itself a necessary factor for repaying debts—the possibility arises that gratitude might enhance other virtues unrelated to exchange that depend on an ability to resist temptation. Here, we examined gratitude’s ability to function as a “parent” virtue by focusing on its ability to reduce cheating. Using real-time behavior-based measures of cheating, we demonstrated that gratitude, as opposed to neutrality and the more general positive emotional state of happiness, reduces cheating in both a controlled laboratory setting (<em>N</em> = 156) and a more anonymous online setting (<em>N</em> = 141). This finding suggests that not all moral qualities need to be studied in silos but, rather, that hierarchies exist wherein certain virtues might give rise to seemingly unrelated others.</li>

<p><em>building long-term empathy: a large-scale comparison of traditional and virtual reality perspective-taking</em><br />
fernanda herrera et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204494">doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204494</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As part of the research, Herrera, along with Stanford psychology scholar Jamil Zaki, Bailenson and psychology graduate student Erika Weisz, conducted two two-month-long studies with more than 560 participants, age 15 to 88 and representing at least eight ethnic backgrounds. Researcher Elise Ogle was also a co-author on the paper.<br />
During the research, some participants were shown “Becoming Homeless,” a seven-minute VR experience developed by Stanford’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab.<br />
In “Becoming Homeless,” a narrator guides participants through several interactive VR scenarios that would happen if they lost their jobs. In one scene, the participant has to look around an apartment to select items to sell in order to pay the rent. In another scene, the participant finds shelter on a public bus and has to protect belongings from being stolen by a stranger.<br />
The researchers found that participants who underwent “Becoming Homeless” were more likely to have enduring positive attitudes toward the homeless than people who did other tasks, such as reading a narrative or interacting with a two-dimensional version of the scenario on a desktop computer. The same people were also more likely to sign a petition in support of affordable housing, according to the research.<br />
“Taking the perspective of others in VR produces more empathy and prosocial behaviors in people immediately after going through the experience and over time in comparison to just imagining what it would be like to be in someone else’s shoes,” Herrera said. “And that is an exciting finding.”<br />
<strong>Measuring empathy over time</strong><br />
Empathy, the ability to share and understand someone else’s emotions, is a critical part of meaningful social interactions, according to scholars. It has been shown to increase people’s understanding of one another and to motivate positive social behaviors, such as donating, volunteering or cooperating with others.<br />
“We tend to think of empathy as something you either have or don’t have,” said Zaki, an assistant professor of psychology and a co-author of the paper. “But lots of studies have demonstrated that empathy isn’t just a trait. It’s something you can work on and turn up or down in different situations.”<br />
The studies’ results showed that participants in the “Becoming Homeless” condition were significantly more likely to agree with statements like “Our society does not do enough to help homeless people.” They were also more likely to say that they personally cared “very much” about the plight of homeless people. The research also showed that their empathetic attitudes toward the homeless endured.<br />
In addition, according to the first study, 82 percent of participants in the VR condition signed a petition supporting affordable housing versus 67 percent of the people who read a narrative that asked them to imagine becoming homeless.<br />
In the second study, 85 percent in the VR condition signed the petition in comparison to 63 percent who read the narrative. Of participants who went through the two-dimensional version of the VR experience, 66 percent signed the petition.<br />
“What’s special about this research is that it gives us longitudinal evidence that VR changes attitudes and behaviors of people in a positive way,” Bailenson said.<br />
<strong>More research ahead</strong><br />
Not all empathy exercises that introduce perspectives of different groups produce positive effects, the researchers said. For example, previous research has shown that when people are asked to take the perspective of their competitors, they become less empathetic toward them.<br />
Similarly, the format of a VR experience also matters when considering how it might alter people’s attitudes, Herrera said.<br />
Herrera, Bailenson and other researchers are working on other studies to figure out the nuances of VR’s effects on people.<br />
But for now, Herrera and her team are excited about the evidence that they have gathered in their new study.<br />
“Long after our studies were complete, some research participants emailed me to reflect on how they started becoming more involved in the issue afterward. One of them befriended a homeless person in their community and wrote me again once that person found a home,” Herrera said. “It was really inspiring to see that positive, lasting impact.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Virtual Reality (VR) has been increasingly referred to as the “ultimate empathy machine” since it allows users to experience any situation from any point of view. However, empirical evidence supporting the claim that VR is a more effective method of eliciting empathy than traditional perspective-taking is limited. Two experiments were conducted in order to compare the short and long-term effects of a traditional perspective-taking task and a VR perspective-taking task (Study 1), and to explore the role of technological immersion when it comes to different types of mediated perspective-taking tasks (Study 2). Results of Study 1 show that over the course of eight weeks participants in both conditions reported feeling empathetic and connected to the homeless at similar rates, however, participants who became homeless in VR had more positive, longer-lasting attitudes toward the homeless and signed a petition supporting the homeless at a significantly higher rate than participants who performed a traditional perspective-taking task. Study 2 compared three different types of perspective-taking tasks with different levels of immersion (traditional vs. desktop computer vs. VR) and a control condition (where participants received fact-driven information about the homeless). Results show that participants who performed any type of perspective-taking task reported feeling more empathetic and connected to the homeless than the participants who only received information. Replicating the results from Study 1, there was no difference in self-report measures for any of the perspective-taking conditions, however, a significantly higher number of participants in the VR condition signed a petition supporting affordable housing for the homeless compared to the traditional and less immersive conditions. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.</p>

<ul>
<li>A virtual reality scenario called “We Wait” gives people an immersive experience of the plight of refugees waiting to be picked up by a boat on a shore in Turkey to be illegally taken to Europe, crossing a dangerous stretch of sea. This was based on BBC news reporting of the refugee situation, but deliberately depicted as an animation with cartoon-like characters representing the refugees. Of interest was the level of presence that might be experienced by participants and the extent to which the scenario might prompt participants to follow-up further information about the refugee crisis. By presence we refer to both Place Illusion, the illusion of being in the rendered space, and Plausibility, the illusion that the unfolding events were really happening. The follow-up was assessed by whether and when participants accessed a web page that contained further information about the refugee crisis after the experiment. Two factors were considered in a balanced between-groups design with 32 participants. The Responsiveness factor was either “None” or “Look at.” In the first the virtual characters in the scenario never responded to actions of the participant, and in the second they would occasionally look at the participant after the participant looked at them. The second factor was Embodiment, which was either “No Body” or “Body.” In the No Body condition participants had no virtual body, and in the Body condition they would see a virtual body spatially congruent with their own if they looked down toward themselves. The virtual body was animated by the head tracking move the upper body. The results showed that the major factor positively contributing to presence was Responsiveness (“Look at”), and that Embodiment (“Body”) may have contributed but to a lesser extent. There were important differences between men and woman in the degree of follow-up, with men more likely to do so than women. The experiment shows that adding in some simple responses in an immersive journalism scenario, where the characters acknowledge the presence of the participant through gaze, can enhance the degree of presence felt by the participants.</li>

<li>Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) seem to have difficulties looking others in the eyes, but the substrate for this behavior is not well understood. The subcortical pathway, which consists of superior colliculus, pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, and amygdala, enables rapid and automatic face processing. A specific component of this pathway – i.e., the amygdala – has been shown to be abnormally activated in paradigms where individuals had to specifically attend to the eye-region; however, a direct examination of the effect of manipulating the gaze to the eye-regions on all the components of the subcortical system altogether has never been performed. The subcortical system is particularly important as it shapes the functional specialization of the face-processing cortex during development. Using functional MRI, we investigated the effect of constraining gaze in the eye-region during dynamic emotional face perception in groups of participants with ASD and typical controls. We computed differences in activation in the subcortical face processing system (superior colliculus, pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus and amygdala) for the same stimuli seen freely or with the gaze constrained in the eye-region. Our results show that when constrained to look in the eyes, individuals with ASD show abnormally high activation in the subcortical system, which may be at the basis of their eye avoidance in daily life</li>

<li>Current research suggests that incidence and heterogeneity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms may arise through a variety of exogenous and/or endogenous factors. While subject to routine clinical practice and generally considered safe, there exists speculation, though no human data, that diagnostic ultrasound may also contribute to ASD severity, supported by experimental evidence that exposure to ultrasound early in gestation could perturb brain development and alter behavior. Here we explored a modified triple hit hypothesis [Williams &amp; Casanova, 2010] to assay for a possible relationship between the severity of ASD symptoms and (1) ultrasound exposure (2) during the first trimester of pregnancy in fetuses with a (3) genetic predisposition to ASD. We did so using retrospective analysis of data from the SSC (Simon's Simplex Collection) autism genetic repository funded by the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative. We found that male children with ASD, copy number variations (CNVs), and exposure to first trimester ultrasound had significantly decreased non-verbal IQ and increased repetitive behaviors relative to male children with ASD, with CNVs, and no ultrasound. These data suggest that heterogeneity in ASD symptoms may result, at least in part, from exposure to diagnostic ultrasound during early prenatal development of children with specific genetic vulnerabilities. These results also add weight to on-going concerns expressed by the FDA about non-medical use of diagnostic ultrasound during pregnancy.</li>

<p><em>altered responses to social chemosignals in autism spectrum disorder</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impaired social communication, often attributed to misreading of emotional cues. Why individuals with ASD misread emotions remains unclear. Given that terrestrial mammals rely on their sense of smell to read conspecific emotions, we hypothesized that misreading of emotional cues in ASD partially reflects altered social chemosignaling. We found no difference between typically developed (TD) and cognitively able adults with ASD at explicit detection and perception of social chemosignals. Nevertheless, TD and ASD participants dissociated in their responses to subliminal presentation of these same compounds: the undetected ‘smell of fear’ (skydiver sweat) increased physiological arousal and reduced explicit and implicit measures of trust in TD but acted opposite in ASD participants. Moreover, two different undetected synthetic putative social chemosignals increased or decreased arousal in TD but acted opposite in ASD participants. These results implicate social chemosignaling as a sensory substrate of social impairment in ASD.</li>

<p><em>role of vta dopamine neurons and neuroligin 3 in sociability traits related to nonfamiliar conspecific interaction</em><br />

<ul>
<li>Atypical habituation and aberrant exploration of novel stimuli have been related to the severity of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), but the underlying neuronal circuits are unknown. Here we show that chemogenetic inhibition of dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) attenuates exploration toward nonfamiliar conspecifics and interferes with the reinforcing properties of nonfamiliar conspecific interaction in mice. Exploration of nonfamiliar stimuli is associated with the insertion of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors at excitatory synapses on VTA DA neurons. These synaptic adaptations persist upon repeated exposure to social stimuli and sustain conspecific interaction. Global or VTA DA neuron-specific loss of the ASD-associated synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin 3 alters the behavioral response toward nonfamiliar conspecifics and the reinforcing properties of conspecific interaction. These behavioral deficits are accompanied by an aberrant expression of AMPA receptors and an occlusion of synaptic plasticity. Altogether, these findings link impaired exploration of nonfamiliar conspecifics to VTA DA neuron dysfunction in mice.</li>

<p><em>predicting empathy from resting state brain connectivity: a multivariate approach</em><br />

<p>Traditionally, empathy is assessed through the use of questionnaires and psychological assessments. The findings of this study offer an alternative to people who may have difficulty filling out questionnaires, such as people with severe mental illness or autism, said senior author Dr. Marco Iacoboni, professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.<br />
“Assessing empathy is often the hardest in the populations that need it most,” Iacoboni said. “Empathy is a cornerstone of mental health and well-being. It promotes social and cooperative behavior through our concern for others. It also helps us to infer and predict the internal feelings, behavior and intentions of others.”<br />
Iacoboni has long studied empathy in humans. His previous studies have involved testing empathy in people presented with moral dilemmas or watching someone in pain.<br />
For the current study, published in <em>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience</em>, researchers recruited 58 male and female participants ages 18 to 35.<br />
Resting brain activity data were collected using functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, a noninvasive technique for measuring and mapping brain activity through small changes in blood flow. Participants were told to let their minds wander while keeping their eyes still, by looking at a fixation cross on a black screen.</p>
<p>Afterward, the participants completed questionnaires designed to measure empathy. They rated how statements such as “I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me” and “I sometimes try to understand my friends better by imagining how things look from their perspective” described them on a five-point scale from “not well” to “very well.”<br />
Researchers wanted to measure how accurately they could predict the participants’ empathic disposition, characterized as the willingness and ability to understand another’s situation, by analyzing the brain scans.<br />
The predictions were made by looking into resting activity in specific brain networks that earlier studies demonstrated are important for empathy. Researchers used a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning, which can pick up subtle patterns in data that more traditional data analyses might not.<br />
“We found that even when not engaged directly in a task that involves empathy, brain activity within these networks can reveal people’s empathic disposition,” Iacoboni said. “The beauty of the study is that the MRIs helped us predict the results of each participant’s questionnaire.”<br />
The findings could help health care professionals better assess empathy in people with autism or schizophrenia, who may have difficulties filling out questionnaires or expressing emotion.</p>
<p>“People with these conditions are thought to lack empathy,” he said. “But if we can demonstrate that their brains have the capability for empathy, we can work to improve it through training and the use of other therapies.”<br />
Furthermore, said lead author Leonardo Christov-Moore, a postdoctoral fellow currently at USC’s Brain and Creativity Institute, this technique may be expanded to improve treatment as well as diagnosis.<br />
“The predictive power of machine learning algorithms like this one, when applied to brain data, can also help us predict how well a given patient will respond to a given intervention, helping us tailor optimal therapeutic strategies from the get-go.”<br />
The study adds to a growing body of research suggesting that brains at rest are as active as brains engaged in a task, and that brain networks in the resting brain may interact in a similar fashion as when they are engaged in a task.<br />
Iacoboni said future, larger studies may help identify other regions of the brain associated with empathy.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Recent task fMRI studies suggest that individual differences in trait empathy and empathic concern are mediated by patterns of connectivity between self-other resonance and top-down control networks that are stable across task demands. An untested implication of this hypothesis is that these stable patterns of connectivity should be visible even in the absence of empathy tasks. Using machine learning, we demonstrate that patterns of <em>resting state fMRI connectivity</em> (i.e. the degree of synchronous BOLD activity across multiple cortical areas in the absence of explicit task demands) of resonance and control networks predict trait empathic concern (<em>n</em> = 58). Empathic concern was also predicted by connectivity patterns within the somatomotor network. These findings further support the role of resonance-control network interactions and of somatomotor function in our vicariously driven concern for others. Furthermore, a practical implication of these results is that it is possible to assess empathic predispositions in individuals without needing to perform conventional empathy assessments.</p>

<p>•Research from diverse subdisciplines of psychology sheds light on Schadenfreude.<br />
•We propose a novel tripartite taxonomy of Schadenfreude: Aggression, rivalry, and justice.<br />
•The process of dehumanization may lie at the core of Schadenfreude.</p>
<p>Schadenfreude is the distinctive pleasure people derive from others’ misfortune. Research over the past three decades points to the multifaceted nature of Schadenfreude rooted in humans’ concerns for social justice, self-evaluation, and social identity. Less is known, however, regarding how the differing facets of Schadenfreude are interrelated and take shape in response to these concerns. To address these questions, we review extant theories in social psychology and draw upon evidence from developmental, personality, and clinical research literature to propose a novel, tripartite, taxonomy of Schadenfreude embedded in a motivational model. Our model posits that Schadenfreude comprises three separable but interrelated subforms (aggression, rivalry, and justice), which display different developmental trajectories and personality correlates. This model further posits that dehumanization plays a central role in both eliciting Schadenfreude and integrating its various facets. In closing, we point to fruitful directions for future research motivated by this novel account of Schadenfreude.</p>

<p><em>empathy is hard work: people choose to avoid empathy because of its cognitive costs</em><br />
c. daryl cameron et al. 2019<br />

<li>
<p>&quot;There is a common assumption that people stifle feelings of empathy because they could be depressing or costly, such as making donations to charity,&quot; said lead researcher C. Daryl Cameron, PhD. &quot;But we found that people primarily just don't want to make the mental effort to feel empathy toward others, even when it involves feeling positive emotions.&quot;</p>
<p>The study, which was published online in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, included 11 experiments with more than 1,200 participants. Cameron led a team of researchers at Penn State University, where he is an assistant professor of psychology, and the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>The researchers designed an &quot;Empathy Selection Task&quot; to test whether cognitive costs, or mental effort, could deter empathy. Over a series of trials, the researchers used two decks of cards that each featured grim photos of child refugees. For one deck, participants were told just to describe physical characteristics of the person on the card. For the other deck, they were told to try to feel empathy for the person in the photo and think about what that person was feeling. Participants were told to choose freely from either deck in each trial.</p>
<p>In some additional experiments, the researchers used decks that featured images of sad or smiling people. When given the choice of choosing between decks, participants consistently picked the decks that didn't require feeling empathy, even for the photos of happy people.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw a strong preference to avoid empathy even when someone else was expressing joy,&quot; Cameron said.</p>
<p>Across all of the experiments, participants on average chose the empathy deck 35% of the time, showing a strong preference for the deck that didn't require empathy.</p>
<p>There also weren't any financial costs for feeling empathy in the study because no one was asked to donate time or money to support child refugees or anyone else featured in the photos.</p>
<p>In survey questions after each experiment, most participants reported that empathy felt more cognitively challenging, saying it required more effort and that they felt less good at it than they did at describing the physical characteristics of other people. Participants who reported that feeling empathy was mentally demanding or made them feel insecure, irritated or distressed were more likely to have avoided the empathy deck during the experiments.</p>
<p>Can people be encouraged to feel empathy if they think they are good at it? In two experiments, half of the participants were told that they were better than 95% of others on the empathy deck and 50% better for the objective physical characteristics deck, while the other group was told the opposite. Participants who were told they were good at feeling empathy were more likely to select cards from the empathy deck and report that empathy required less mental effort.</p>
<p>The cognitive costs of empathy could cause people to avoid it, but it may be possible to increase empathy by encouraging people that they can do it well, Cameron said.</p>
<p>&quot;If we can shift people's motivations toward engaging in empathy, then that could be good news for society as a whole,&quot; Cameron said. &quot;It could encourage people to reach out to groups who need help, such as immigrants, refugees and the victims of natural disasters.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Empathy is considered a virtue, yet it fails in many situations, leading to a basic question: When given a choice, do people avoid empathy? And if so, why? Whereas past work has focused on material and emotional costs of empathy, here, we examined whether people experience empathy as cognitively taxing and costly, leading them to avoid it. We developed the empathy selection task, which uses free choices to assess the desire to empathize. Participants make a series of binary choices, selecting situations that lead them to engage in empathy or an alternative course of action. In each of 11 studies (N = 1,204) and a meta-analysis, we found a robust preference to avoid empathy, which was associated with perceptions of empathy as more effortful and aversive and less efficacious. Experimentally increasing empathy efficacy eliminated empathy avoidance, suggesting that cognitive costs directly cause empathy choice. When given the choice to share others’ feelings, people act as if it is not worth the effort.</p>

<p>in an environment where most other people care too little, for an empath it becomes a huge burden to care. to avoid burning out, we must care less, or rather, in a different way, otherwise the stress of being unable to care–as–we–wish–to will destroy our health.</p>
<p>in such an uncaring environment, without support, we may be the only ones that can look after our own health, so we must make sure to do that, as otherwise we will lose the ability to act as our health declines.</p>
<p>for example, if our partner does not or cannot care enough, then we must devote time to caring for our own wellbeing, as the level of caring that each partner would provide to the other, in a balanced relationship, is not adequately present in this relationship to maintain our health.</p>
<p>if that means that we cannot give as much caring as we would like at present, we must console ourselves by thinking of the longer term, that this makes it possible to give caring over a longer time as we will stay alive longer.</p>

<li>instead of questioning the suitability of the model, most current practical solutions accept the model, and instead attempt to unsuccessfully decouple an aspect of it. for example, many sensitives turned to alcohol or drugs or even suicide to reduce their sensitivity or destroy their memory. ascetics try to decouple their cognitive process altogether. these are adaptive strategies which try to cope with the consequences of this model rather than deal with a root cause.</li>

<li>just like we need to actively recall memories to strengthen them, so too do we need to create our own exercises of empathy and do them. if we are watching a television show and the character is going through many different lifetimes and worlds, we think of this again later and imagine what it is to live like that.</li>

<li>people identify with their groups through the groups’ commonplaces: if this is true, is this why i don't identify with groups, because i don't identify with their commonplaces? is this why i don't feel close to people, because I don't emphasise what we have in common? is this how people alienate themselves from society, by building a false reality far from the truth, they can ensure that they can never really identify with it and so alienate themselves from society.
<ul>
<li>most people differentiate between friend and stranger, they treat strangers much worse than friends. we treat everyone the same, as friends and potential friends.</li>
<li>is this because I have no envy? so can be happy for people in all their endeavours as do not compare each other, only share in joy.</li>

<li>why empathy is essential: if you have little empathy with your future self then you have few qualms doing things you will regret in future
<ul>
<li>those with better empathy, all other things being equal, will be those who succeed more in life, because they will make better choices more consistently</li>

<li>
<p>i’ve always wondered why some people would laugh at the suffering of others. what makes them different from me? what in their fate or life experiences lead them to laugh while others weep?</p>
<p>what series of traumas made them lose their ability to feel another person’s suffering — or perhaps, what series of traumas honed my ability to do so?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>sensitive people assume they must be sensitive all the time. This is wrong. like an amputee or someone who wins the lottery, we adapt. because someone who is sensitive may expect to be sensitive all the time because of this illusion, they misunderstand how they are feeling when they're no longer particularly sensitive. this may lead to suffering or self harm.</li>

<li>appreciate
<ul>
<li>empaths have the curious issue of appreciating what others do, even if it is not obviously visible. however, it may be harder for empaths to understand and deal with the fact that most others will not appreciate what they do, especially if it is not obviously visible.</li>
<li>the harder something is to do, the more unlikely it is that society will appreciate its worth, because if it were easier, not only would it be more likely it had already be done, but also more people would understand it and therefore understand why it is useful, or important.</li>
