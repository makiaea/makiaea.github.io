<p><em>manipulating beliefs about losing control causes checking behaviour</em><br />
jean-philippe gagné, adam s. radomsky 2017<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocrd.2017.08.013">doi.org/10.1016/j.jocrd.2017.08.013</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>•A broader conceptualization of beliefs about control over thoughts is proposed.<br />
•A manipulation of beliefs about control with a focus on losing control is tested.<br />
•Manipulating beliefs about a potential loss of control led to checking behaviour.<br />
•Checking behaviour predicted a lower desire for control.<br />
•Beliefs about losing control should potentially be targeted during CBT.</p>
<p>Cognitive theories of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/obsessive-compulsive-disorder">obsessive-compulsive disorder</a> (OCD) posit that maladaptive beliefs lead to the development of symptoms. However, psychometric studies have provided mixed evidence regarding whether beliefs about control over thoughts predict OCD symptoms above and beyond other obsessive beliefs. Clinical reports have documented concerns among those diagnosed with OCD regarding a potential loss of control over their thoughts <em>and behaviour</em>, indicating that broadening the scope of beliefs about control by integrating aspects of <em>losing control</em> may better explain their role in OCD. In this study, 133 undergraduate participants underwent a bogus <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/electroencephalography">EEG</a> session and received (positive or negative) false feedback about the possibility that they may lose control over their thoughts and behaviour, and completed a task asking them to control the pace of pictures. As hypothesized, participants in the high (versus low) beliefs about losing control condition checked significantly more often which keys they should use to control the pictures, <em>t</em>(106.95) = 2.28, <em>p</em> = .02, <em>d</em> = .44, demonstrating that manipulating beliefs about control can impact <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/checking">checking</a> behaviour when a potential loss of control is emphasized. Also, checking behaviour predicted a lower desire for control, such that compulsions may be seen as opportunities to re-establish disrupted control cognitions.</p>

<p><em>race and recession: effects of economic scarcity on racial discrimination</em><br />
krosch, amy r. et al. 2017<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1037/pspi0000112">doi.org/10.1037/pspi0000112</a></p>
<ul>
<li>When the economy declines, existing racial disparities typically expand, suggesting that economic scarcity may promote racial discrimination. To understand this pattern, we examined the effect of perceived scarcity on resource allocations to Black and White American recipients, and tested whether this effect depends on a decision maker’s motivation to respond without prejudice. We proposed that scarcity would lead to increased discrimination among those with relatively low internal motivation but not those high in internal motivation. Indeed, we found that when resources were framed as scarce (vs. abundant or a control condition), low-motivation participants allocated less to Black than White recipients, whereas high-motivation participants allocated more to Black than White recipients (Studies 1 and 2). This pattern was strongest when decisions could be made deliberatively (Study 3), and anti-Black allocation bias emerged even in a non-zero-sum context (Studies 4 and 5), suggesting a strategic bias directed against Black recipients rather than in favor of White recipients. These findings indicate that the psychological perception of scarcity can produce racial bias in the distribution of economic resources, depending on the motivations of the decision maker—an effect that may contribute to the increase in racial disparities observed during economic stress</li>

<p><em>swing voting in the 2016 presidential election in counties where midlife mortality has been rising in white non-hispanic americans</em><br />

<p>•Changes in mortality can be seen as a marker of social upheaval.<br />
•The results of the 2016 US presidential election were unexpected by many.<br />
•Mortality was a strong correlate of voting patterns in the 2016 US election.<br />
•Wider health inequalities were also correlated with shifting voting patterns.</p>
<p>Understanding the effects of widespread disruption of the social fabric on public health outcomes can provide insight into the forces that drive major political realignment. Our objective was to estimate the association between increases in mortality in middle-aged non-Hispanic white adults from 1999 to 2005 to 2009–2015, health inequalities in life expectancy by income, and the surge in support for the Republican Party in pivotal US counties in the 2016 presidential election. We conducted a longitudinal ecological study in 2764 US counties from 1999 to 2016. Increases in mortality were measured using age-specific (45–54 years of age) all-cause mortality from 1999 to 2005 to 2009–2015 at the county level. Support for the Republican Party was measured as the party’s vote share in the presidential election in 2016 adjusted for results in 2008 and 2012. We found a significant up-turn in mortality from 1999 to 2005 to 2009–2015 in counties where the Democratic Party won twice (2008 and 2012) but where the Republican Party won in 2016 (+10.7/100,000), as compared to those in which the Democratic Party won in 2016 (−15.7/100,000). An increase in mortality of 15.2/100,000 was associated with a significant (p &lt; 0.001) 1% vote swing from the 2008–2012 average to 2016. We also found that counties with wider health inequalities in life expectancy were more likely to vote Republican in 2016, regardless of the previous voting patterns. Counties with worsening premature mortality in the last 15 years and wider health inequalities shifted votes toward the Republican Party presidential candidate. Further understanding of causes of unanticipated deterioration in health in the general population can inform social policy.</p>

<p><em>independent relationship of changes in death rates with changes in us presidential voting</em><br />
lee goldman et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-018-4568-6">doi.org/10.1007/s11606-018-4568-6</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dr. Goldman and colleagues hypothesized that changes in health outlook may have affected the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. To test this hypothesis, they used publicly available data from each of the country’s 3,112 counties to compare changes in presidential voting from 2008 to 2016 with changes in death rates. The analysis controlled for race/ethnicity, income, education, unemployment rates, health insurance rates, and other factors.<br />
Both 2016 presidential candidates received fewer votes than the 2008 Republican and Democratic presidential candidates in 398 counties. And while President Trump fared better than Senator John McCain in 2,607 counties, Secretary Hillary Clinton surpassed President Obama’s percentage of the vote in only 108 counties.<br />
Counties with a net gain in the percentage of individuals who voted for the Republican candidate had a 15 percent higher 2015 age-adjusted death rate than counties with a net gain in Democratic voters. The increase in death rates due to alcohol, drugs, and suicide was also 2.5 times higher in counties where Republicans made gains compared with counties where Democrats made gains.<br />
“It’s commonly argued that President Trump won by receiving more votes from people who have been left behind economically — especially older, less-educated, and less-urban, white voters,” said Dr. Goldman. “Based on our data, we can also say that changes in life expectancy were an independent factor in voting choices. Reduced health prospects are an important marker of dissatisfaction, discouragement, hopelessness, and fear — sentiments that may have resonated with voters who sided with President Trump. Although correlation does not imply causality, our findings also suggest that plausible improvements in life expectancy in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin might have shifted their electoral votes to Secretary Clinton.<br />
“Regardless of your political persuasion, our paper suggests that if health disparities were important enough to influence presidential voting, they may have an even broader impact on our country’s future than we had imagined,” said Dr. Goldman. “It also highlights how much work remains to reduce health disparities.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> In 2016, President Trump increased the Republican presidential vote percentage in 83.8% of counties compared with Senator McCain in 2008. Counties with an increased Republican vote percentage in 2016 vs. 2008 had a 15% higher 2015 age-adjusted death rate than counties with an increased Democratic vote percentage. Since 2000, overall death rates declined by less than half as much, and death rates from drugs, alcohol, and suicide increased 2.5 times as much in counties with Republican gains compared with counties with Democratic gains. In multivariable analyses, Republican net presidential gain in 2016 vs. 2008 was independently correlated with slower reductions in a county’s age-adjusted death rate. Although correlation cannot infer causality, modest reductions in death rates might theoretically have shifted Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin to Secretary Clinton.</p>
<p>Conclusions<br />
Less of a reduction in age-adjusted death rates was an independent correlate of an increased Republican percentage vote in 2016 vs. 2008. Death rates may be markers of dissatisfactions and fears that influenced the 2016 Presidential election outcomes.</p>

<p><em>fear, populism, and the geopolitical landscape: the ‘sleeper effect’ of neurotic personality traits on regional voting behavior in the 2016 brexit and trump elections</em><br />
martin obschonka et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1177/1948550618755874">doi.org/10.1177/1948550618755874</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Two recent electoral results—Donald Trump’s election as U.S. president and the UK’s Brexit vote—have reignited debate on the psychological factors underlying voting behavior. Both campaigns promoted themes of fear, lost pride, and loss aversion, which are relevant to the personality dimension of neuroticism, a construct previously not associated with voting behavior. To that end, we investigate whether regional prevalence of neurotic personality traits (neuroticism, anxiety, and depression) predicted voting behavior in the United States (<em>N</em> = 3,167,041) and the United Kingdom (<em>N</em> = 417,217), comparing these effects with previous models, which have emphasized the roles of openness and conscientiousness. Neurotic traits positively predicted share of Brexit and Trump votes, and Trump gains from Romney. Many of these effects persisted in additional robustness tests controlling for regional industrial heritage, political attitude, and socioeconomic features, particularly in the United States. The “sleeper effect” of neurotic traits may profoundly impact the geopolitical landscape.</li>

<li>
<p>i’ve this song in my head and i know the tune<br />
but i don’t know the words<br />
to say that the song in my head is you<br />
and it’s the best i’ve ever heard</p>
<p>it keeps me humming with a grin on my face<br />
i even tap my foot if there’s enough space<br />
but...</p>
<p>if you don’t feel the same way just let it be said<br />
and i’ll get this song out of my head</p>
<p>but if somehow this song thing is going both ways<br />
and i’m in your mind too<br />
much for you to be happy with me far away<br />
then we both know what to do</p>
<p>and think of all of the fun<br />
if we played each other on repeat one<br />
but...</p>
<p>if you don’t feel the same way just let it be said<br />
and i’ll get this song out of my head</p>
<p>what if i’m the only one of us who fell<br />
how will i find a song that i love so well?<br />
but...</p>
<p>if you don’t feel the same way just let it be said<br />
and i’ll get this song out of my head</p>

<li>loss
<ul>
<li>
<p>they invent science and philosophy and religion and time all in an effort to regain what is lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“the way i look at loss, is that it is a two sided coin. you cannot feel the pain of losing something or someone without also recognizing the beauty that thing or person held for you. so even though it hurts to have lost that bottle of wine, remember that it is the love of your grandparents that made the bottle special for you. that love, and those memories, are things no one will ever be able to take from you.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>although at times we may perceive things like loss, scarcity, and death very keenly, this does not mean that they are the source nor the most important things in the world. as much as he implied it, darwin may have been wrong to assume these, in natural selection, as the attendants to evolution.</p>

<li>economic/social obligation as reproduction limiter: as populations “develop”, their birth rate declines. but why? one reason not much researched is link to increase in life expectancy — as we live longer, we use more resources individually, so less can be devoted to children. older parents caring less for grandchildren, but rather needing care themselves. exploitatative measures in favour of older population reduce allocation for younger — expensive end–of–life care rather than schools, escapist fantasy instead of looking to future. in a way it might be irrelevant that they are manipulated by bad actors, because it is the concentration of power, the low diversity of power, which is the root cause. that concentration of power can be easily manipulated by bad actors.</li>

<li>gain and loss, scarcity and abundance
<ul>
<li>life evaluation based on this, perhaps from resource and mate scarcity</li>
<li>scarcity as driver, but only in scarce conditions.</li>
<li>rarity, or, alternatively, abundance, are often used as markers of value. indeed, the previous sentence makes use of this assumed correspondence, via the word often.</li>
<li>in a similar way, what we do not encounter is devalued, is given less value, if it is assigned any value at all. this is an error of our judgement, not a valid representation of reality.</li>
<li>a fair number of our errors in judgement come from this kind of convolution in our understanding. from the neglect of our language to the neglect of time, or rather, of change.</li>
<li>measuring worthiness by power is wrong, so too with uniqueness.</li>
<li>illusory limit of human recall often assumed to be what we can consciously recall. this illusory limit is then fought for as a scarce resource by spells, habits, ideas — that wish to monopolise the resource and perpetuate themselves in other people. in reality our learning is not limited to what we can consciously recall — nor are our resources and abilities limited this way</li>
<li>I tend to use resources only when I need to, so that others with greater need have opportunity</li>
<li>one of the odd things about being a supposedly rare kind of person (an honest, trustworthy and incorruptible one) is that people don't quite know how to deal with you because they feel they are different to you.</li>
<li>more or less of something does not make it better or worse. more, less, better, worse, things, doing, making, being — these are all illusions</li>
