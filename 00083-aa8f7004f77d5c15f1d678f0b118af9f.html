<h2>The cold air rushes in as I push the bicycle out the front door. Carrying it down the steps is a little awkward as the wires for the brakes are on the undersides of the frame, and I have yet to find good handholds from which to lift it. A glance and listen to left and right, push off into the road. Turning on to the main road, the downhill slope gives me speed and the cold wind chills my bare legs. Whose bright idea is it to wear shorts to get some sun in the winter? No matter, the velodrome is just ahead. Take a short lap around the track and dismount to start the run. On my feet, I feel warmer and safe enough to let my attention drift from the tarmac in front to the green fence and flint rock wall to the side, to the silhouette of the trees against the grey sky above promising rain. Doing more sprints than I'd intended, each lap slightly different</h2>
<h2>The trees were tall, and my daughter wanted to touch the leaves. Higher, she babbled, higher! I could not lift her higher, and I was humbled. But I was joyful too, for one day she would touch the stars.</h2>
<h2>I am on a sand bridge and the breakers crash over the way ahead. I hesitate to move into the spray where I cannot know the safety of the path. I hold in my hands a small branch to probe the sand for weakness.</h2>

<li>let's write a story where the mentor is tired of trying with the million failures and is now just going through the motions. and of course the reader is the one who surprises him because is still reading.</li>
<li>if this so powerful why not hide it better? because it has to be within you first for it to work. the spell is self selecting.</li>

<li>its all about the warning. if there are things you can't do because you are in the water, you need to get the warning to those on land so they can do those things, such as locate you both for rescue or take covers off covered exit pools so that you can both reach air and safety.</li>

I get a nervous feeling and question whether we should be doing this, as we don't know what is included in the package… and before me stands a girl, baring her teeth, showing her long fangs. I am frightened for a moment, then realise she is grinning because she finally found me again.</h2>

<h2>i don't believe in fate, but sometimes things happen that i don't believe… one night i dreamed something awful happened. my friend was abrupt because the student seemed not to listen well. the student died later that day. my friend blamed herself, especially when she found out the student had only been distracted because of a death in the family. the dream seemed to say this was not my friend's fault, the student did not blame her at all, and wanted her to know this. i wondered who this message was for, which friend i needed to pass this on to. should i appear strange by telling my dream to every friend who i saw that day, in case the message was for them? i needn't have worried. the message, it seems, was for me.</h2>
