<h1><em>the tyranny of words</em></h1>
<p>stuart chase 1938<br />
NB he is “unreconstructed” i.e. believes women and men should fulfill different roles</p>
<h2>“As I see it, there are three main counts against the philosophic method.</h2>
<ul>
<li>First, the waste of time on unanswerable or meaningless questions —“being”, “becoming”, “the one”, “the superman”, the nice distinctions between “Humanism”, “Realism”, and “Materialism”.</li>
<li>Second, the application of philosophical deductions to the real world, with the result of distorting knowledge of that world. Trying to make the world behave as the words behave.</li>
<li>Third, arousing public opinion —usually unintentionally— to violent action when the facts warrant no such action. Witness Nietzsche as used by the Germans in 1914, and Spengler as used by the Nazis to-day.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>on economics</h2>
<ul>
<li>“It is a safe rule that any study where students cannot agree upon what they are talking about is outside the scientific discipline.</li>
<li>I employ a skilled mechanic to mow my meadow and cultivate my garden. He used to be employed in a Connecticut mill, but a new machine was installed and he and some others lost their work. So he is keeping himself and his family alive as best he can at a fraction of his former income. He was a victim of what is termed “technological unemployment”. A machine took his work from him, and for a considerable period he could find no other work to do. He might have left town, but he had bought a house, his children were in school, his wife liked the neighbourhood, and to take to the road was a risky venture with machinists out of work on every hand. Now what do the classical economists do with my friend Roy Thompson?</li>
<li>They prove by irrefutable logic that technological unemployment is impossible. I know what I am saying, for I have debated the matter in public with classical economists and can tick off the arguments with my eyes shut. The logic proceeds like this: A new machine is put into a pin factory to take the place of men. The cost of making pins is lowered. Presently competition lowers the price of pins as the machine is generally adopted. Therefore housewives spend less money for pins and have more money to spend for silk stockings. Therefore the factories making stockings employ more help, and no unemployment results. On the other hand, if the first factory has a monopoly of the new machine, and does not choose to lower the price of pins, the owner of the factory takes in more money. This money he either spends, let us say for a private airplane, or invests in a new pin factory. Workers have to build the airplane or the factory, giving more employment. On purely logical grounds, you cannot get round it. Employment shifts, but does not decline and the same amount of money continues in circulation. Q.E.D.</li>
<li>How do you get round it? You look steadily at Roy Thompson, at scores of still less fortunate Roy Thompsons. You adopt the operational approach, disregard the logic in your head, and observe what is happening outside. You are careful not to generalize from one or two cases. In the world of fact, you find that men and women frequently lose their jobs to machines, to stop-watch efficiency methods, to photoelectric cells, to improvements in agricultural methods. You can count them if you have the heart, leaving their benches and their tools and going out upon the street. You can examine the curves of output per man-hour for this commodity and that and note how they have been rising for fifty years. You can halt any working man and ask him to tell you how he or his friends have lost their work from time to time because of new inventions.</li>
<li>It is not hard to check and recheck the facts of technological unemployment. Referents for the term are very plentiful. Very good —or rather, very bad. Millions of Roys have suffered for a greater or lesser period. Do they find other work? Many of them do. Often, like Roy, they learn new trades at inferior pay. But the increasing obstinacy of unemployment in the modern world indicates that many do not. Whether they do or do not, certain relevant human factors must be brought into the concept. Can Roy1 after twenty years of working at a lathe shift his skill to qualify as a linesman if men are wanted in that field? Can Roy2, after living forty years in Middletown with his roots driven deep pick up his family and move to Seattle if men are wanted on the docks? Can Roy3 now unemployed hibernate like a woodchuck and live without eating because a year hence there is to be a demand for machinists in the television industry? Can Roy4 change from man's work in a machine shop to woman's work in a rayon factory? <em>What kind</em> of employment awaits him? <em>Where</em> does it await him? <em>When</em> does it await him?”</li>
<li>“Classical economics not only was largely innocent of the scientific method; it also became a kind of theology selling indulgences to businessmen. As factories expanded after Watt's steam engine, a philosophy was needed to give respectability and prestige to the rising class of manufacturers. The philosophy was first identified with the “natural laws” of Newton. Then it twined itself like a boa constrictor (yes, I am conscious of abstracting) around Darwin's hypothesis of the “survival of the fittest”. What a handout! The greatest good for the greatest number, so ran the dogma, arises from the unimpeded competitive activities of enlightened self-interest. The faster the stragglers are bankrupted and undone, the stronger the economic frame. What appears as competitive anarchy is not really anarchy at all, but a beneficent system of control by natural forces. The big fish eats the little fish, the strong businessman eats the weak. It is all very gratifying and lovely, and as remote from reality as the labours of Hercules.</li>
<li>In 1798, Malthus published his famous essay on population, one of the grandest examples of extrapolation on record. The essay was in part designed to answer William Godwin's argument to the effect that mankind could achieve happiness through the use of reason. Malthus wanted to scotch the dangerous idea that happiness was in prospect for the mass of the people. (The principle of “original sin” again.) So by study of the exceedingly unreliable statistics of the time, he laid down two postulates: first, that population tends to grow at a geometrical rate; second, that the food supply tends to grow at an arithmetical rate. The population of England was then 7,000,000; in a hundred years if the curve was followed it would be, he said, 112,000,000. If food was sufficient for the 7,000,000 in 1800, by 1900 the supply would expand to feed only 35,000,000 —“which would leave a population of 77,000,000 totally unprovided for”.</li>
<li>This fantastic hypothesis was then solemnly applied to the problem of poverty. As population was destined to leap ahead of food supply, restrained only by pestilence, war, and famine, it followed that measures to improve the living-standards of the mass of the people were futile. “It is, undoubtedly, a most disheartening reflection, that the great obstacle in the way of any extraordinary improvement in society, is of a nature that we can never hope to overcome”. That stopped the fellow Godwin in his tracks. The essay was also used for decades as conclusive proof that reform laws were pernicious. In the second edition of his essay, in 1803, Malthus relented to the point where a new element was introduced into his equations. If the poor would employ “moral restraint” in their procreational activities, they might possibly gain a notch or two on the food supply. It was very cheering news to the well-to-do. The poor had themselves to blame for their poverty, and even if moral restraint was widely practised, poverty was largely inevitable anyhow.</li>
<li>Malthus's iron law of population was paralleled by Ricardo's iron law of wages. This great principle put poor people in another vice. Since labour is a commodity, said Ricardo, its price goes up and down with demand. When demand for labour is slack, wages will remain at the bare-subsistence level. If demand becomes brisk, wages will rise, workers will have more money. They will then produce more children, and presently the addition to the population will bring the price of labour back to bare-subsistence level again. So what is the use of trying to improve the condition of the workers?</li>
<li>Nassau Senior “proved” that hours of labour could not be reduced, because the employer's profit came out of the last hour of operation. A 68-hour week was common at the time. Eliminate that last hour, he said, and industrial profits would be eliminated, and the business of the nation ruined. Thus if children in factories worked 67 hours rather than 68, panic would replace prosperity. Senior's analysis was derived from theoretical examples where the arithmetic was correct but the assumptions untenable.</li>
<li>Senior's contribution to economic theory proved that hours could not be reduced. John Stuart Mill and other classicists proved that wages could not be raised, by the famous “wage-fund doctrine[16]”. Workers joined unions and struck for a raise. Pure madness, said the economists. Why? Because there was a certain fund set aside out of capital for the payment of wages. There was a certain number of wage-earners. Divide the first by the second. It was all arranged by Heaven and arithmetic, and trade unions could do nothing about it. The wage-fund theory was the stock answer of the manufacturer and editor to the claims of organized workmen. It had been blessed by economists and must be true.</li>
<li>Observe how these “laws” were put to tangible use, holding back improvements in working conditions for scores of years. The philosophers produced nonsense which was at least disinterested. Many of these classical economists had an axe to grind, and cruelly sharp they ground it. Not until 1876 was the wage-fund theory exploded by an American economist, Francis Walker. He argued that wages were paid not out of a fund of stored capital, but out of current earnings —a theory which came closer to the facts. It is a pleasure to note that John Stuart Mill, who first popularized the wage-fund hypothesis in his Principles of Political Economy in 1848, published the following statement years later: “The doctrine hitherto taught by most economists (including myself) which denied it to be possible that trade combinations can raise wages… is deprived of its scientific foundation, and must be thrown aside”. A brave, fine statement. But working people in England and elsewhere for fifty years had paid a bitter price for a “law” that had no scientific foundation.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>marx</h2>
<ul>
<li>“The classical economists fitted out the businessman with a fine new philosophical suit. The workers went spiritually ragged until Karl Marx came along with fine new suits for them. Marx's philosophy was the first comprehensive statement of the theory of socialism. As an offset to the classicists, it was badly needed. As a contribution to knowledge, the case is more dubious. In drawing inferences from the facts which he had so conscientiously collected, he mixed in Ricardo's labour theory of value, Hegel's interpretation of history (thesis, antithesis, synthesis), and a large and very human dose of emotional sympathy for the downtrodden, together with hatred for their exploiters. So the final product was part scientific observation, part classical theory, part contemporary philosophy, part good, rousing propaganda.</li>
<li>The followers of Marx, by and large, have dropped the scientific observation overboard, and clung to the theory, the philosophy, and the hatred. Their facts are still drawn from the England of 1850. They have turned this great scholar into a kind of demigod. Current questions are settled not by the facts of to-day but by the authority of the Master: “Marx says…” Aristotle and the Schoolmen over again. To check the inferences of Marx by operational experiment to-day would be a long, arduous undertaking. Here we have but time to note one or two tests.</li>
<li>Marx drew his concept of dialectical materialism from Hegel. Hegel we remember as the metaphysician who upbraided the astronomers for trying to find more planets when philosophy had established the number at 7 for eternity. “Of all the philosophers since Plato”, observes Hogben, “none has adopted a world view more diametrically opposed to the scientific outlook”.</li>
<li>Perhaps Hegel's chief accomplishment was the re-establishment of the occult properties of the number 3. The secret of the universe, he said, lies in finding out how reason works. Reason equals unity. Waste no time on experiment or observation. Every argument which arises in the quest of the absolute consists of three parts (the magic three):</li>
<li>The first step —which Hegel seldom succeeded in taking— is a plain statement, and is called “thesis”.</li>
<li>The second step is the negation or contradiction of that statement, and is called “anti-thesis”.</li>
<li>The third step is the negation of the negation, combining the higher truth in both the preceding steps. It is called “synthesis”.</li>
<li>All history, said Hegel, follows this law. Marx, in applying the parade of abstractions to economics, identified capitalism as thesis, labour as antithesis, and the classless society as synthesis. Neat and logical, but what does it mean? Where are the referents? There is no vestige of the scientific method here. The dialectic tells us that when two forces clash, something happens. We knew that before. It does not tell what the things are with any clarity, and it makes a wild extrapolation as to the result.</li>
<li>Marx moves closer to the real world when he leaves Hegel and his magical triad, and says that methods of production determine human culture. Operations can be performed to show the great effect of, for instance, mass production on human living and human institutions. But Marx went off the deep end by making this verifiable tendency into an absolute. He dropped out many characteristics —as moralists drop them in the case of the “bad” girl. Elements of race, religion, climate, plagues, and many other things help determine human culture too. Take a look at Hans Zinsser's Rats, Lice and History for a demonstration of the profound effects of parasites (biological, not economic) upon human culture. The essential point to grasp semantically is that Marx used his mind like a philosopher, not like a scientist, in his concepts of dialectical materialism. True, he was a better analyst than most philosophers; but to hold that he established a rigorous and inevitable course which history must take is akin to holding a belief in the second coming of Christ. The assertions in the “proof” are verbal and so unverifiable.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Poor humanity is not indulging so much in moral failure as in bad language</h2>
<ul>
<li>“Why do all of us have such a dreadful time living up to our principles?</li>
<li>Such questions have haunted me for years. A certain cheap satisfaction can be derived from exposing contradictions in the opinions of those one does not agree with, but how about the alarming contradictions in one's own opinions and behaviour? When one sees clearly that most principles, as currently affirmed, are unattainable because they have no contact with reality, the pain of such contradictions is eased. If a man affirms that his purpose in life is to jump over the moon and he does not do it, you are not grieved because poor humanity does not live up to its principles. Many principles will be found to be moon-jumps when referents are sought for. Poor humanity is not indulging so much in moral failure as in bad language.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>“Suppose we try to describe a trained semanticist a decade or more hence.</h2>
<ul>
<li>I picture a good-humoured young man with quick eyes and a slow tongue. You doubtless know the type and perhaps belong to it yourself. (For “young man” also read “young woman”.) Sensible and tolerant to start with, he has developed these qualities and others until he can make a clear judgment as skilfully as a trained patternmaker stamps a die. He will be aware of the growth and the structure of language. He will have some scientific knowledge about the world outside him on the three levels of macroscopic or normal, microscopic, and submicroscopic; and some knowledge of the senses, the cortex, and nerve currents, inside. He will have a clear idea of what the scientific method means, for which he must perform from time to time a few simple scientific experiments. He will know a fact from an inference as a watchdog knows his master from a chicken thief. He will know when an inference is a sober hypothesis and when it is a drunken extrapolation. He will cut down on his use of the “is” of identity. He will try never to forget that words are as much symbols as p and q and have no power in themselves. He will be extremely conscious of high-order abstractions, constantly on the search for referents, with the operational approach always in his cartridge belt.</li>
<li>He will be wary of terms with emotional tie-ups, such as “rugged individualism” and “sanctity of the home”. He will be practically impervious to most debates, arguments, and heated discussions, except for clinical purposes. He will devote little time to classical philosophy, political commentaries, polite essays, or newspaper editorials, but he will appreciate fiction, poetry, accounts of travel and exploration, and competent research work. His natural sense of humour will be pleasantly exercised by constant search for verbal spooks. His standard of evaluation will be survival and comfort: Does this event seem to contribute to improved conditions of human livelihood, or does it not? About other principles he will be diffident. He will tend, through no particular merit of his own, to become more kindly in his judgments. This is inevitable as he shifts from a one- or two-valued to a multiple-valued standard, and ceases to class “bad” girls or “lazy” boys as wholly bad or wholly lazy. The two-valued logic of absolute choice between “either” and “or” will no longer bind him. He knows that in a given situation there are normally many choices. As he begins to look outside rather than inside, rigidities and hatreds will tend to melt. His country is not going to the dogs because of what a labour leader or a President or a great banker says he is going to do, or even because of what they do. When he takes a stand, it will be based not on hifalutin principles but on factual information. It will be a pleasure to see him fight when the stand is taken.</li>
<li>The young semanticist will realize that he cannot acquire useful concepts by thinking alone. Most concepts also demand doing. It is perfectly hopeless to sit down and think about “money”, “credit”, “democracy”, “sex”, “internationalism”. The cortege turns into a merry-go-round. No, if he wants more knowledge, he must go outside his mind and observe things in action, take measurements and records, inspect the results of those who have observed and recorded. He knows that if a concept is inconstructable and unworkable in the real world, it is meaningless. And from time to time he remembers Stefansson's account of the ostrich in The Standardization of Error. The ostrich, by popular accord and definition, is a bird which buries its head in the sand at the approach of danger. Actual or biological ostriches, however, run like hell.</li>
<li>His mind will be open for exciting discoveries in the real world —inventions, new ways of employing energy, new sorts of atoms, finer observations in medicine and physiology, but especially verifiable knowledge about political and social affairs. He will tend to be at peace with his environment, content with the understanding that this is his world and he is a part of it, and not yearning for other worlds whose locations, dates, and compositions cannot be determined.”</li>

Our task is to thrust aside dogma, one-valued judgments, untenable identifications, and so come closer to what is actually going on beyond our skins. We cannot, alas! bring these matters into the laboratory as the scientist can bring cosmic rays, but we can learn to use our minds like scientists. We can adopt the operational approach; we can appreciate the flexibility of concepts; we can avoid fraudulent explanations of the new in terms of the old; above all, we can strive for the great discipline of agreement.”</li>

<p>“Principles provide standard rules for judgment and for conduct. Instead of investigating the facts of a situation, one claps a principle upon it. If the principle happens to fit the facts, it may be a useful timesaver. If it is based on facts of a bygone age, its application to new facts and new conditions may be ridiculous or disastrous. Principles often make sense at the time of their origination —although the Aryan myths which the Nazis are now formulating into principles make no sense at all. The trouble is that after adoption, people begin to regard them as eternal, good for any situation, anywhere, at any time.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“In semantic terms, a principle is a judgment involving high-order abstractions, normally without referents, difficult to test by experiment or operation, revered for itself as such. Some principles appear to make life more tolerable; a greater number have the opposite effect. By intoning principles, and particularly by saying that the application of this great ideal hurts me more than it does you, one can perform many unkind acts with a clear conscience. When we believe in the Malthusian explanation of the slums (the “law” of population growth makes them inevitable), slums cease to trouble us. When we believe that the highest good is a balanced budget, the misery of those cut from relief rolls is a secondary matter. When we are convinced that any worthy man can get a job, unemployment can be disregarded and measures to alleviate it can be opposed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A hypocritical person can use principles as smoke screens to further personal ends, but a sincere person often follows them blindly for their own sake, regardless of individual gains or losses. Thus some employers who are opposed to labour unions on principle are prepared to lose millions of dollars rather than sully their ideals. What they personally lose, society, they hope, will some day gain.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Most people are kind and humane in ordinary situations. But when a given reform becomes entangled with their principles, many of them turn cruel.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“The late Professor E. S. Robinson, of Yale, follows along a similar path. He notes in his Psychology and the Law four kinds of explanations which people give to justify their beliefs:</p>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The impulsive: Much used by primitive man on the idea that any explanation was better than none.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>The authoritarian: It is so because the good book, the King or the medicine man says it is so.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>The rationalistic: It is so because I have reasoned it out in my head (on the left side of the triangle). The facts must fit this reasoning. If they do not, they are unimportant.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>The scientific: “Here the standard of validity is found in a world of stubborn and irresistible fact which originates outside the thinking process, but which offers “a constant discipline and obligation to the honest intellectual life”.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In dealing with the physical world the test of fact is generally accepted as supreme. In dealing with the world of social control it is widely believed that there are other tests more to be respected —authority, internal consistency, rationalistic thinking, historic principles. To see the world as it is, says Robinson, rather than suffused with the rosy light of principles, is not an effort to get along without ideals, aims, and aspirations; “it is an effort to make these purposes real, to make them attainable in concrete terms”. High ideals can result in the Thirty Years' War between Catholic and Protestant, or they can result in the vital activities of the Red Cross. On the one side death, on the other life. With more looking outward and less looking inward we might shift our behaviour toward the Red Cross side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both Robinson and Arnold advance a strong case for mental fictions. They hold that without principles to guide them most men would feel as naked as they would walking down the street without their clothes. Perhaps a collection of fictions is inevitable. But I confess I look forward to the day when we shall dispense with concepts not derived from careful observation and from the necessities of survival and well-being under the conditions of this earth. Nothing else can we know surely, and nothing else should be bowed down to. Or so it seems to me.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Our understanding of nature is non-existent apart from our mental processes, so that strictly speaking no aspect of psychology or epistemology is without pertinence”. Thus semantics takes a front seat at the beginning of the performance.”</p>

<p>“The heart of the Ogden and Richards analysis can be diagrammed by a triangle as given on the following image.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><div style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"><svg viewBox="0 0 500 271" version="1.1" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin meet" style="width: 100%;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><image width="500" height="271" xlink:href="05139-8cf74be5b96ca76c2e0e7b6909ecfe56-assets/508250C7-DB87-4631-BE8A-C044D08FE652/image.jpg"></image></svg></div></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The triangle is not a pattern of nerve channels, but a diagram showing relations, and so a structural presentation. From the outside world, and sometimes from a pain or other stimulus inside, we receive a sign. “A sign may be any stimulus from without or process within”. This sign we proceed to interpret, to find meaning in. Interpretation, as noted earlier, depends on past experience. The sound of a match scraped upon a box leads us to expect a flame. If we had never known matches, the sign would be without meaning —though a savage might possibly misinterpret it as a devil scratching his ear. The sight of an opened oyster will cause a pleasurable interpretation if we have learned to enjoy oysters, and apathy or disgust if oysters have never been encountered. Human experience is a series of sign situations, followed by reflection and the filing of references in the brain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sign calls up the object —the match, the oyster, the pencil— which is labelled the “referent”. The referent is the Thingumbob to which the sign “refers. We often say, “‘chien’ means ‘dog’” when we should say that the words “chien” and “dog” both refer to the same animal. In the cortex, the files of memory are consulted and interpretation takes place. This process Ogden and Richards label “reference”, or thought. The “referent” is that to which reference is made. So far, this process applies to all higher animals. Man alone takes the next step. He verbalizes the reference with a word, phrase, or “symbol”. From sign to referent to reference to symbol —that is the order. Animals can limp around the triangle by using a few meaningful cries and gestures in place of words. The words of a parrot skip the top of the triangle altogether.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observe that the triangle has no base. This is a matter of the first importance. There is no direct relation between referent and symbol, between thing and word, and there cannot be —except where the symbol is a “gesture, such as pointing to the oyster. Even then the reference or thinking mechanism is used. Yet human beings are constantly leaping from word to thing, identifying word with thing. “The most prolific fallacy of human intercourse is that the base of the triangle is filled in”. Try as you may, you cannot eat the word “oyster”, cannot sit on the word “chair”, cannot live on the word “money”. The confusion of the symbol “money” with things in the real world required for survival and comfort is perhaps the central economic difficulty of modern times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The triangle gives us the key to the allied semantic problem, the misuse of abstractions. Clear communication demands referent, reference, and symbol, all three. Suppose we disregard referent, and simply think about words, using words to externalize that thinking. We cut three factors to two. We then produce great activity on the left side of the triangle —from reference to symbol and back to reference again. The great words roll round and round. The “sublime” merges into the “good” and both into the “eternal”. “Liberty” merges into “individualism” and both into “true democracy”. “National Socialism” merges into “racial purity” and both into “totalitarianism”. “Many leaders who mould popular ideas and principles perform with a singular exclusiveness on the left side of the triangle. In the next political discussion that you hear, watch for this left-handed performance, and take what amusement you can. More often it frightens me. What on earth —literally on earth— are these people talking about? They start far up the abstraction ladder with magnificent disregard for the referent. Yet unless both speaker and hearer are aware of a similar referent, minds cannot meet, agreement cannot be reached, communication is checked as effectively as when one snaps off a radio.”</p>

<p>“The point of every discussion is to <em>find the referent</em>.”</p>

<p><em>science and sanity: an introduction to non-aristotelian systems and general semantics</em><br />

<p>“If one is unconscious of abstracting, he gives to words a definite, one-valued meaning —“She is a bad girl, with no ifs, ands, or buts”. He interprets another person's speech as always having that meaning. His reactions tend to be hasty and emotional, largely from the thalamus region. He jumps down your throat with “You're wrong!” He is full of ultimate truths and eternal principles. With abstractions fixed as entities rather than consciously recognized as verbal tags, we begin to worry about “worry”, and develop a fear of “fear”. A hospital for nervous diseases looms not far ahead. Belief in “belief” meanwhile leads to fanaticism and dogmatism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Young men and women make an entity out of the abstraction “marriage”, conceiving it to be an actual state blissful beyond imagining. When they marry, the resulting shock is needlessly great. “Heaven” is less devastating, because its devotees can file no later reports —except in spook parlours. Boys in 1917 who expected war to be a horrible business suffered less from shell shock, according to Korzybski, than those suffused with “glory”, “patriotism”, and a “battle for democracy”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observe that in the semantic approach to abstractions there is no plea to “think things through” —the stock retort of one dogmatist to another. “Thinking things through” has heretofore largely meant more useless mental labour —from thought to word and back to thought again. Here, on the contrary, we are trying to find the object, the referent to which the thought and word refer, and after that to discover its attributes and relationships. This means a new discipline in many “fields, a tearing-down of the scaffold of what has passed for thought and building afresh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The structure of language inherited from our primitive ancestors is such that it provides separate terms for factors which are inseparable in fact. “Matter”, “space”, “time”, constitute one such group; “body”, “mind”, constitute another. We thus try to split in our heads what is unsplittable in the real world.”</p>
