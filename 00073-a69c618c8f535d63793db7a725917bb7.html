<li><em>zeigarnik effect</em><br />
in 1927, russian psychologist bluma zeigarnik demonstrated that people have a better memory for incomplete than complete tasks. once a task is finished, we stop thinking about it. but when it is interrupted and left undone, it stays active in our minds.</li>

<p><em>the brain adapts to dishonesty</em><br />
neil garrett et al. 2016<br />

<ul>
<li>Dishonesty is an integral part of our social world, influencing domains ranging from finance and politics to personal relationships. Anecdotally, digressions from a moral code are often described as a series of small breaches that grow over time. Here we provide empirical evidence for a gradual escalation of self-serving dishonesty and reveal a neural mechanism supporting it. Behaviorally, we show that the extent to which participants engage in self-serving dishonesty increases with repetition. Using functional MRI, we show that signal reduction in the amygdala is sensitive to the history of dishonest behavior, consistent with adaptation. Critically, the extent of reduced amygdala sensitivity to dishonesty on a present decision relative to the previous one predicts the magnitude of escalation of self-serving dishonesty on the next decision. The findings uncover a biological mechanism that supports a 'slippery slope': what begins as small acts of dishonesty can escalate into larger transgressions.</li>

<p>•Voluntary reaction times are slower and more variable than neural noise explains<br />
•Such procrastination is theorized to reflect a neural race selecting each action<br />
•Electrically disrupting medial frontal cortex reverses procrastination<br />
•A cardinal prediction of race models of action in the brain is thereby confirmed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An enduring puzzle in the neuroscience of voluntary action is the origin of the remarkably wide dispersion of the reaction time distribution, an interval far greater than is explained by synaptic or signal transductive noise [1, 2]. That we are able to change our planned actions—a key criterion of volition <a href="http://www.richardwiseman.com/research/papers.html">3</a>—so close to the time of their onset implies decision-making must reach deep into the execution of action itself [4, 5, 6]. It has been influentially suggested the reaction time distribution therefore reflects deliberate neural procrastination [7], giving alternative response tendencies sufficient time for fair competition in pursuing a decision threshold that determines which one is behaviorally manifest: a race model, where action selection and execution are closely interrelated [8, 9, 10, 11]. Although the medial frontal cortex exhibits a sensitivity to reaction time on functional imaging that is consistent with such a mechanism [12, 13, 14], direct evidence from disruptive studies has hitherto been lacking. If movement-generating and movement-delaying neural substrates are closely co-localized here, a large-scale lesion will inevitably mask any acceleration, for the movement itself could be disrupted. Circumventing this problem, here we observed focal intracranial electrical disruption of the medial frontal wall in the context of the pre-surgical evaluation of two patients with epilepsy temporarily reversing such hypothesized procrastination. Effector-specific behavioral acceleration, time-locked to the period of electrical disruption, occurred exclusively at a specific locus at the ventral border of the pre-supplementary motor area. A cardinal prediction of race models of voluntary action is thereby substantiated in the human brain</p>

<p><em>practice makes perfect: experiential learning as a method for financial socialization</em><br />
ashley b. lebaron et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0192513x18812917">http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0192513x18812917</a></p>

<p>Much of the existing literature on financial socialization focuses on two things: the example parents set for their children, and what moms and dads directly teach their kids about money. However, research often overlooks a third important piece: giving kids hands-on practice managing money, says a new paper authored by University of Arizona doctoral student Ashley LeBaron.</p>
<p>The paper &quot;Practice Makes Perfect: Experiential Learning as a Method of Financial Socialization,&quot; published in the Journal of Family Issues, explores the importance of parents giving children real-world experience with money to help prepare them financially for adulthood. The study suggests that future research should consider this sort of experiential learning a third key method of financial socialization.</p>
<p>Parents can give their kids practice with money in a variety of ways. They might give them a regular allowance, pay them for tasks that go above and beyond their normal chores, reward good grades with cash, or encourage them to save for special purchases or charitable donations. The specifics don't really matter, nor does the amount of money, which may vary based on a family's financial situation, LeBaron said.</p>
<p>The important thing is that parents give children hands-on experience with money early, when the stakes are still low.</p>
<p>&quot;If the first time kids use a credit card or have to work or have to save up for something or have a bank account is when they're on their own, that's not a good time to be practicing,&quot; said LeBaron, a doctoral student in the Norton School of Family and Consumer Sciences in the UA College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.</p>
<p>&quot;It's important for parents to give kids age-appropriate financial experiences when they're monitoring them,&quot; LeBaron said. &quot;Let them make mistakes so you can help them learn from them, and help them develop habits before they're on their own, when the consequences are a lot bigger and they're dealing with larger amounts of money.&quot;</p>
<p>LeBaron and her collaborators at Brigham Young University interviewed 115 study participants, including 90 college students ages 18-30, as well as some of those students' parents and grandparents. They asked the students what and how their parents taught them about money, and in the case of parents and grandparents, also asked what and how they taught their own children about money.</p>
<p>Most participants said they had been given some sort of experience with money in their youth, and they considered that experience to be extremely valuable in preparing them to manage money on their own. Those who didn't get those kinds of experiences wished that they had.</p>
<p>Based on the interviews, LeBaron and her collaborators identified three main themes around what participants learned from the financial experiences they were given as children: how to work hard, how to manage money and how to spend wisely. The researchers also identified three primary reasons why parents said they provided their children with hands-on experience with money: to help them learn financial skills, acquire financial values and become independent.</p>
<p>LeBaron, who is a millennial, said she was interested in studying financial socialization partly because of the persistent stereotype that millennials are bad with money. She began to wonder if perhaps younger generations were not given the same degree of hands-on experiences with money that their parents and grandparents had.</p>
<p>While LeBaron doesn't yet have data to support those generational differences, she suspects many parents today may hesitate to trust their kids with money -- and that could be problematic down the line.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's hard for parents, sometimes, to let their kids make mistakes,&quot; LeBaron said. &quot;It's tempting to just shield kids from everything related to money, but it's really important for parents to get money into kids' hands early on so they can practice working for it, managing it and learning how to spend it wisely.&quot;</p>
<p>Ideally, LeBaron said, parents will teach their kids about money through modeling, explanation and hands-on experience.</p>
<p>&quot;The best approach is a combination, where parents are setting a good example, they're having open, ongoing conversations about money, and kids have the opportunity to practice,&quot; she said. &quot;If parents are doing all three of those things, there's a really good chance their kids are going to learn important lessons about money.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Most financial socialization research focuses on two methods of learning: modeling and discussion. The purpose of this study is to qualitatively explore experiential learning as a third potential method of financial socialization used by parents. Specifically, we explored what children learned about finances through experiential learning and why parents used experiential learning as a financial socialization method. We used a multigenerational sample of emerging adults (ages 18-30 years) and their parents and grandparents (N = 115). Analyses revealed three core what themes (Working Hard, Managing Money, and Spending Wisely) and three core why themes (Learning Financial Skills, Acquiring Financial Values, and Becoming Financially Independent) related to experiential learning. These findings have implications for parents, researchers, and educators. In sum, we propose that experiential learning should be regarded as a principal method of financial socialization and should be considered in theory building, research, and pedagogy.</p>

<p><em>attainment versus maintenance goals: perceived difficulty and impact on goal choice</em><br />
antonios stamatogiannakis et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2018.09.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2018.09.002</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>•Difficulty judgments of attainment and maintenance goals are monitored differently.<br />
•Current-end state discrepancy (vs. context) has more impact for attainment goals.<br />
•Context (vs. current-end state match) has more impact for maintenance goals.<br />
•Modest attainment goals, though harder, can appear easier than maintenance goals.<br />
•Differences in judged difficulty can influence consequential goal choices.</p>
<p>We argue that individuals monitor and evaluate attainment and maintenance goals differently. Attainment goals feature a salient current-end state discrepancy that is processed more than the corresponding match for maintenance goals. For maintenance goals, for which a salient discrepancy is absent, contextual influences on goal success/failure receive more processing than for attainment goals. Thus, objectively more difficult attainment goals may be judged as easier than maintenance goals, when they feature sufficiently small discrepancies, or when context information is unfavorable. Study 1 establishes this core effect. Study 2 shows that thought listings capturing the relative processing of the current-end state discrepancy (match) and context information mediate perceived goal difficulty. Study 3 shows that the favorability of context information moderates the effect. Study 4 establishes joint difficulty evaluations as a boundary condition. Studies 5 and 6 (and Appendix B) show that such goal difficulty judgments affect consequential goal choices in real-world financial, workplace, and shopping situations.</p>

<p><strong>symbolic photograph</strong> this is a serendipitous photograph. it was taken within thirty seconds of entering one of the hothouses at kew gardens in london, england. after that the hothouse was closed for the day. can you see certain details in the photograph? the sky is reflected in the water. it turns out that maki was due to leave for san diego, halfway around the world from london, in a few days time so this was the last time in two years that he would have a chance to take this particular photograph. he was lucky. but there was also serendipity. the photograph shows the scene in a hothouse in england, where these tropical water–flowers are blooming. the symbolism is very appropriate because it is an interesting metaphor for the blooming of human spirit in unlikely surroundings. the cast–iron latticework of the roof appears in the reflection, indicating the human agency in the presence of th eflowers in that location. but nevertheless, the flowers are beautiful. they are not beautiful because anyone placed them there, but are beautiful just as they are. this is what made this photograph an ideal one to symbolise the book somesuch(link).</p>

“for it is langmuir's conviction that 'calculation upon the unforseen' is not only consonant with scientific principle but that it will also pay off in other ways that are highly desirable. Calculation upon divergent phenomena will produce results that are both unexpected <em>and</em> important: 'You don't know all the things that are going to happen. Too many of them are unexpected. And it is many of these unexpected things that are going to be the most profitable, the most useful things you do.’”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“The crowning reward of such general planning is that it will preserve a freedom of inquiry, a freedom of opportunity, that is not only rational and efficient but is also part of a good way of life. 'Freedom of opportunity as developd by democracy is the best human reaction to divergent phenomena. We may, in fact, define 'freedom' as 'the opportunity to profit from the unexpected.' 'It is in the best interests of science and of democratic society therefore that serendipity be held in high esteem.”</p>

<li>the ideas in my mind do not tend to coalesce, do not “collapse the wave function” until external influence, usually discussions with friends or words I have read. an interesting view of this is that there is no reason for them to do so except under external influence. in my everyday life I act without requiring that they collapse into words, the words are not necessary for consideration and action, but they are used for discussion and some ways of sharing.</li>
