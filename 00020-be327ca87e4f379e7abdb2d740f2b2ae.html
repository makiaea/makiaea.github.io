<li>an answer is to grow our society, one which rejects abuse so they can no longer take power from us. each and every person can relearn that these chains do not bind us. we awaken from this nightmare of abuse to a new dawn — the dawn of a great civilisation</li>
<li>it is not “idealism” that is counter to abuse, but understanding that whatever form abuse takes, we must counter it. if someone cries “idealism”, they parrot the arguments of abusive people without thinking, or are abusive themselves.</li>
</ul>

<p>the odd thing is that abusive people tend to gravitate towards positions in society where they can indulge their abusive behaviour. a responsible person, since they can do many things, is not tied to one path.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>“Mary Kern and I expanded on the model of bounded ethicality and have developed a model of “ethical learning” which takes the psychology of good-ish people into account. We redefine what it means to be a good person as someone who is trying to be better, as opposed to someone who is allowing themselves to believe in the illusion that they are always a good person.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“in a growth mindset, we still make mistakes and we learn from them, which makes mistakes less likely in the future. In a growth mindset, it is possible to make good mistakes. Some people worry that if mistakes are accepted as part of learning, then we give people a free pass to make mistakes. Yet research says that when we view ourselves as works-in-progress, we are more willing to hold ourselves accountable for our actions. We are more likely to apologize to people we have hurt and we offer better, more complete apologies. Accountability is higher, not lower, when we give ourselves room to grow.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Our behavior seems most prone to our implicit biases when we are under great time pressure or stress. Even when we are more deliberative, we may not realize the extent to which we form judgments based on implicit biases.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you have the tailwind, you will not notice that some runners are running into headwinds. They may be running as hard as, or even harder than, you, but they will appear lazier and slower to you. When some of them grow tired and stop trying, they will appear self-destructive to you.</p>
<p>The invisibility of headwinds and tailwinds leads us to vilify people facing headwinds. It is no coincidence that the groups facing great headwinds in our society are also the most negatively stereotyped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>our avoidance of self-threat does not have to win. Systems that support whiteness over blackness are hard to see, and when they are made visible, it is normal for self-threat to kick in. Research finds that when white people feel self-threat about their whiteness, they turn to one of three strategies. They may deny the privilege, like antibelievers. They may distance themselves from other white people, akin to the hard-knock life effect. Or they may work toward dismantling inequality and promoting change, the approach of moving from believer to builder.</p>
<p>If you are drawn to either of the first two strategies, you are missing an opportunity. In the first strategy, you do not see the need for change. In the second strategy, you see the need but are less likely to engage in work that makes meaningful change. In the third strategy, you are able to see what is happening and participate actively.</p>
<p>A bit of affirmation and we can better see the systems, the privilege, the personal advantage. In fact, scholars Miguel Unzueta and Brian Lowery got white people to think of racism in systemic terms by explicitly affirming the individual first. While we will not always have a researcher on standby to do this, we can do it ourselves. In other words, if we can find our own cookies without burdening other already-burdened people</p>

<li>
<p>what people perceive is both incorrect and much like the world they want to see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our tendency toward bounded awareness is also affected by where we sit in society’s formal and informal hierarchies. Power reinforces bounded awareness. Even a minimal amount of power and a minimal reminder of that power have profound effects on human thinking and behavior. A vast research literature shows that power shifts our focus from others to ourselves. We become more egocentric and are less likely to see the perspectives and emotions of others.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>the believing may be fooling us into seeing the world as more fair than it really is. Comforted by our beliefs, we do not realize our biases are exacerbating the very problems we wish to solve. When we don’t see what is in front of us, we strip ourselves of the ability to address it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>train our eyes to look for the things we do not see by seeking perspectives from people different than us. We need to ask the questions we are intuitively not going to think of, those that might prove us wrong rather than right. We need to ask for people outside our echo chambers to share their experiences by earning their trust that we will listen fully to what they have to say. We need to keep asking questions when there is consensus in the data or in the room by resisting the urge to assume that the majority speaks for the minority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the society in which we live is structured around these identities. Those whose identities do not vary from the norm are lulled into thinking that their experience is universal. People with other identities are reminded of their difference from the norm on a regular basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are tough obstacles to moving from believer to builder. Our minds do not see everything in front of them. What we do see is what we want to see. We have surrounded ourselves with people like us. We know that we will be less likely to see a world in which meritocracy is not assumed, especially if we have a hint of power or money. As we learn what we do not want to know and as the invisible becomes visible, we may want to turn away—even (or especially) as believers. Builders opt for more awareness at these points. As we will see next, it is often a matter of will (and grace).</p>

<p><em>early experiences of threat, but not deprivation, are associated with accelerated biological aging in children and adolescents</em><br />
jennifer a. sumner et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2018.09.008">doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2018.09.008</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Background<br />
Recent conceptual models argue that early life adversity (ELA) accelerates development, which may contribute to poor mental and physical health outcomes. Evidence for accelerated development in youths comes from studies of telomere shortening or advanced pubertal development following circumscribed ELA experiences and neuroimaging studies of circuits involved in emotional processing. It is unclear whether all ELA is associated with accelerated development across global metrics of biological aging or whether this pattern emerges following specific adversity types.<br />
Methods<br />
In 247 children and adolescents 8 to 16 years of age with wide variability in ELA exposure, we evaluated the hypothesis that early environments characterized by threat, but not deprivation, would be associated with accelerated development across two global biological aging metrics: DNA methylation (DNAm) age and pubertal stage relative to chronological age. We also examined whether accelerated development explained associations of ELA with depressive symptoms and externalizing problems.<br />
Results<br />
Exposure to threat-related ELA (e.g., violence) was associated with accelerated DNAm age and advanced pubertal stage, but exposure to deprivation (e.g., neglect, food insecurity) was not. In models including both ELA types, threat-related ELA was uniquely associated with accelerated DNAm age (β = .18) and advanced pubertal stage (β = .28), whereas deprivation was uniquely associated with delayed pubertal stage (β = −.21). Older DNAm age was related to greater depressive symptoms, and a significant indirect effect of threat exposure on depressive symptoms was observed through DNAm age.<br />
Conclusions<br />
Early threat-related experiences are particularly associated with accelerated biological aging in youths, which may be a mechanism linking ELA with depressive symptoms</li>

<li>“tolerance, viewed as a moral absolute, amounts to renouncing the right to self-protection; but viewed as a peace treaty, it can be the basis of a stable society. Its protections extend only to those who would uphold it in turn. To withdraw those protections from those who would destroy it does not violate its moral principles; it is fundamental to them, because without this enforcement, the treaty would collapse. It is appropriate, even ethical, to answer force with proportional force, when that force is required to restore a just peace. We seek peace because on the whole it is far better than war; but as history has taught us, not every peace is better than the war it prevents.”</li>

<p><em>motivating the adoption of new community-minded behaviors: an empirical test in nigeria</em><br />
graeme blair et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aau5175">doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aau5175</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>media, such as films, can shift social norms and combat corruption. In the case of &quot;Water of Gold,&quot; in Nigeria, the film clearly can change behavior. Or at least one version of the film.</p>
<p>As it happens, &quot;Water of Gold&quot; is a &quot;Nollywood&quot; film (a loose term referring to the Nigerian film industry, the world's third-largest), commissioned for the purposes of this experiment. The movie, set in the Niger Delta, is a sibling story about two brothers. One brother, Natufe, is a poor fisherman. But Natufe's brother, Priye, leaves the Niger Delta, gets rich in business, returns home, and becomes a corrupt politician -- to the dismay of Natufe, who becomes outspoken about endemic local corruption.</p>
<p>In one version of &quot;Water of Gold,&quot; Natufe and another local activist set up a number for corruption reporting via text message and report instances of it, in scenes lasting five minutes. The other version does not contain those scenes. As the researchers discovered, &quot;Water of Gold&quot; does boost corruption reporting among viewers -- but only when it contains the extra 17 minutes showing the movie characters reporting corruption themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;When we added the extra scenes in the film, we found we did get more people reporting,&quot; says Rebecca Littman, now a postdoc at MIT and co-author of a new paper detailing the study's findings.</p>
<p>Indeed, the movie, and an accompanying mass text message, spurred 240 people in 106 small communities to send in concrete, specific reports of corruption over a seven-month period, a marked improvement compared to two national campaigns that generated 140 reports per year, in a country of 174 million people.</p>
<p>By combining texting with the film, it becomes &quot;less costly, and psychologically easier, to try this new thing,&quot; Littman says about corruption reporting.</p>
<p>The paper summarizing the results, &quot;Motivating the adoption of new community-minded behaviors: An empirical test in Nigeria,&quot; is being published today in Science Advances. The authors are Graeme Blair, of the University of California at Los Angeles; Littman, a researcher at the MIT Sloan School of Management; and Elizabeth Levy Paluck of the department of psychology at the Woodrow Wilson School of Princeton University. Littman worked on the study as a graduate student at Princeton and is now a researcher in the Human Cooperation Laboratory, run by David Rand, an MIT Sloan professor.</p>
<p>To conduct the study, the researchers both commissioned &quot;Water of Gold&quot; and then rolled it out in careful fashion. Among the 106 places where the film was available, in 2013 and 2014, it was randomly determined whether viewers would see the &quot;treatment&quot; version of the film, with the corruption-reporting scenes, or the &quot;placebo&quot; version, which lacks them.</p>
<p>Both versions of the movie were also accompanied by a new system for reporting corruption via text message, which was displayed on the film's packaging and at the beginning, middle, and end of the film. Soon after handing out the films, the researchers then sent out a mass text message blast in each community, to all subscribers of the major mobile phone provider, so people simply had to reply in order to report corruption.</p>
<p>In the paper, the researchers term the film a &quot;norms intervention,&quot; designed to shift public opinion about civic standards. The texts are what they term a &quot;nudge intervention,&quot; intended to reduce the perceived logistical difficulties of reporting corruption.</p>
<p>The alteration of norms generated by the film involves making people feel that reporting corruption is a routine part of being a good citizen. In case people have not encountered others in their community who speak out against corruption, the film steps in to provide an example of reporting malfeasance.</p>
<p>&quot;If we can't show them their neighbor doing it, we can show them these influential, famous people doing it too,&quot; Littman says.</p>
<p>Nigeria would seem to provide a setting where anticorruption campaigns have room to grow. In a public-opinion survey conducted as part of the research project, just under 80 percent of Nigerians said they thought the police, civil servants, and state governments were corrupt. About 83 percent of respondents said they were &quot;angry&quot; about having to pay bribes to conduct business, with 60 percent being &quot;very angry&quot; about it.</p>
<p>It is also no accident that the study focused on the Niger Delta region, where massive amounts of oil production have not been accompanied by an equivalently substantial investment in services and infrastructure for citizens.</p>
<p>Even so, the number of corruption reports the research experiment generated was significant compared to two four-year campaigns, running from 2011 to 2015, conducted by a pair of organizations, Integrity Nigeria and BribeNigeria.com, which combined to collect 385 reports.</p>
<p>&quot;I think people were surprised that the campaign actually worked,&quot; Littman says</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Social scientists have long sought to explain why people donate resources for the good of a community. Less attention has been paid to the difficult task of motivating the first adopters of these important behaviors. In a field experiment in Nigeria, we tested two campaigns that encouraged people to try reporting corruption by text message. Psychological theories about how to shift perceived norms and how to reduce barriers to action drove the design of each campaign. The first, a film featuring actors reporting corruption, and the second, a mass text message reducing the effort required to report, caused a total of 1181 people in 106 communities to text, including 241 people who sent concrete corruption reports. Psychological theories of social norms and behavior change can illuminate the early stages of the evolution of cooperation and collective action, when adoption is still relatively rare.</p>

<p><em>local support for conservation is associated with perceptions of good governance, social impacts, and ecological effectiveness</em><br />

<p>researchers surveyed small-scale fishermen in six European countries about their perceptions of and support for marine protected areas (MPAs).</p>
<p>&quot;The Mediterranean and Black Seas are fished at biologically unsustainable levels, by the regions' fishing fleet, 80 per cent of which are small-scale fishers,&quot; said Nathan Bennett, lead author and research associate in the University of British Columbia's Institute for Ocean and Fisheries and in the ECOSEAS lab at the Université Côte d'Azur. &quot;Gaining local support for one of the area's common management tools -- marine protected areas (MPAs) -- is vital to ensure conservation measures are in place and successful in the long-run.&quot;</p>
<p>The survey focused on three key factors -- ecological effectiveness, social impacts, and good governance -- and how these related to local support. Overall, respondents were supportive of marine protected areas overall with 29 per cent voicing strong support, and only 5.4 per cent expressing strong opposition. Ecologically, the respondents felt that MPAs had a positive impact for fish abundance and habitat quality.</p>
<p>Social impact indicators, including income, livelihoods, food security, knowledge, community social well-being, and connections to nature, were mostly neutral. However, the responses were not as optimistic for the 'fairness of the impacts' or for good governance indicators such as recognition, transparency, accountability, communication, participation, consultation and consent, conflict management, trust, rule of law, and legitimacy.</p>
<p>&quot;Results show that for small-scale fishers, perceptions of good governance and social impacts were stronger predictors than ecological effectiveness of their support for conservation efforts.&quot; said Bennett. &quot;This has important implications for conservation managers. Building relationships, ensuring transparency, managing conflicts and conducting outreach activities are important investments to ensure local people support conservation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The take home-message is that working with and communicating to stakeholders will foster support for conservation initiatives,&quot; said Paolo Guidetti, senior author and professor at the Université Côte d'Azur. &quot;We hope that this study will help governments and managers in the Mediterranean Sea, and elsewhere in the world, to create more effective marine protected areas.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Local support is important for the longevity of conservation initiatives. The literature suggests that perceptions of ecological effectiveness, social impacts, and good governance will influence levels of local support for conservation. This paper examines these relationships using data from a survey of small‐scale fishermen in 11 marine protected areas from six countries in the Mediterranean Sea. The survey queried small‐scale fishermen regarding perceptions and support for conservation. We constructed composite scores for three categories of perceptions—ecological effectiveness, social impacts, and good governance—and tested the relationship with levels of support using ordinal regression models. While all three factors were positively correlated with support for conservation, perceptions of good governance and social impacts were stronger predictors of increasing support. These findings suggest that employing good governance processes and managing social impacts may be more important than ecological effectiveness for maintaining local support for conservation.</p>

<em>the hard-knock life? whites claim hardships in response to racial inequity</em><br />
taylor phillips, l.; lowery, brian s. 2015<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2015.06.008">doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2015.06.008</a></p>
<ul>
<li><em>abstract</em> Racial inequity continues to plague America, yet many Whites still doubt the existence of racial advantages, limiting progress and cooperation. What happens when people are faced with evidence that their group benefits from privilege? We suggest such evidence will be threatening and that people will claim hardships to manage this threat. These claims of hardship allow individuals to deny that they personally benefit from privilege, while still accepting that group-level inequity exists. Experiments 1a and 1b show that Whites exposed to evidence of racial privilege claim to have suffered more personal life hardships than those not exposed to evidence of privilege. Experiment 2 shows that self-affirmation reverses the effect of exposure to evidence of privilege on hardship claims, implicating the motivated nature of hardship claims. Further, affirmed participants acknowledge more personal privilege, which is associated with increased support for inequity-reducing policies.</li>

<em>the wealth paradox: prosperity and opposition to immigration</em><br />

<ul>
<li><em>abstract</em> The idea that economic downturns and economic deprivation provoke tensions and intergroup hostility is remarkably pervasive. These accounts often work from the premise that economic crises and poverty provide “fertile soil” for populist parties and leaders with an anti-immi- grant agenda. This may explain why we intuitively expect that “hard times” produce “harsh attitudes” towards minorities. However, there is also robust empirical evidence showing that intergroup hostility (and anti-immigration sentiments more specifically) can (i) surge in times of economic prosperity, and (ii) be widespread among relatively affluent groups. In this article, I will review evidence showing that intergroup hostility (such as anti-immigrant sentiments) can be equally prevalent in times of relative gratification as well as in times of relative depriva- tion (accounting for the “Wealth Paradox”). In the second part of this contribution, I will explore these processes through the lens of classic social identity theorising focusing on the way that status anxiety, status threat, and fear of falling among members of wealthier groups are shaped by the permeability of group boundaries and the security of wealth positions. I argue that social identity theorising, typically applied to explain the behaviour of low status groups, can provide a parsimo- nious and integrative account for why and when high status (i.e., as a result of affluence and prosperity) may be associated with hostility towards minorities rather than with greater tolerance.</li>

<p><em>hypocognition and the invisibility of social privilege</em><br />
kaidi wu, david dunning 2020<br />

<ul>
<li><em>abstract</em> Are members of socially dominant groups aware of the privileges they enjoy?<br />
We address this question by applying the notion of hypocognition to social privilege. Hypocognition is defined as lacking a rich cognitive or linguistic representation (i.e., a schema) of a concept in question. By social privilege, we refer to advantages that members of dominant social groups enjoy because of their group membership. We argue that such group members are hypocognitive of the privilege they enjoy. They have little cognitive representation of it. As a consequence, their social advantage is invisible to them.<br />
Approach. We provide a narrative review of recent empirical work demonstrating and explaining this lack of expertise and knowledge in socially dominant groups (e.g., Whites, men) about discrimination and disadvantage encountered by other groups (e.g., Blacks, Asian Americans, women), relative what members of those other groups know.<br />
Findings. This lack of expertise or knowledge is revealed by classic cognitive psychological measures. Relative to members of other groups, social dominant group members generate fewer examples of discrimination that other groups confront, remember fewer instances after being presented a list of them, and are slower to respond when classifying whether these examples are discriminatory.<br />
Social Implications. These classic measures of cognitive expertise about social privilege predict social attitude differences between social groups, specifically whether people perceive the existence of social privilege as well as believe discrimination still exists in contemporary society. Hypocognition of social privilege also carries implications for informal interventions (e.g., acting “colorblind”) that are popularly discussed.</li>

<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4977962">doi.org/10.1063/1.4977962</a></p>
<ul>
<li>“Inequality” is a common observation about us, as members of society. In this article, we unify physics with economics by showing that the distribution of wealth is related proportionally to the movement of all the streams of a live society. The hierarchical distribution of wealth on the earth happens naturally. Hierarchy is unavoidable, with staying power, and difficult to efface. We illustrate this with two architectures, river basins and the movement of freight. The physical flow architecture that emerges is hierarchical on the surface of the earth and in everything that flows inside the live human bodies, the movement of humans and their belongings, and the engines that drive the movement. The nonuniform distribution of wealth becomes more accentuated as the economy becomes more developed, i.e., as its flow architecture becomes more complex for the purpose of covering smaller and smaller interstices of the overall (fixed) territory. It takes a relatively modest complexity for the nonuniformity in the distribution of wealth to be evident. This theory also predicts the Lorenz-type distribution of income inequality, which was adopted empirically for a century.</li>

<ul>
<li>We propose a new typology of paternalistic leadership styles based on how leaders demonstrate authoritarianism and benevolence, the two essential components of this type of leadership. Benevolence-dominant paternalistic leadership refers to leaders’ sole dependence on the use of benevolence without their strong assertion of authority, whereas authoritarianism-dominant paternalistic leadership is based mainly on authoritarianism itself; classical paternalistic leadership, which best fits early observations of paternalistic leaders, refers to the salient combination of both leadership components. We used two distinct samples and methods to test this typology and the association with subordinate performance. Across the two studies, a field investigation with Taiwanese military supervisor-subordinate dyads and a hypothetical scenario experiment with U.S. working adults, we found a positive relationship between classical paternalistic leadership and subordinate performance as strong as that between benevolence-dominant paternalistic leadership and performance. Our findings echo the phenomenon that paternalistic leaders tend to combine benevolence with authoritarianism to affect subordinate performance.</li>

<li>Almost all students witnessed school violence, which predicted impairment. Witnessing violence was associated with risk of subsequent adjustment problems 2 years later. Directly experienced victimisation showed a comparable magnitude of risk. This suggests that when it comes to symptoms of conduct disorder, witnessing violence might have the same impact as experiencing it directly. Witnessing earlier covert and major violence predicted social impairment whereas minor violence predicted psychological and academic impairment.</li>

<p><em>breaking the cycle of abusive supervision: how disidentification and moral identity help the trickle-down change course</em><br />

<a href="http://doi.org/10.1037/apl0000360">doi.org/10.1037/apl0000360</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;Some employees who are abused by their bosses resolve not to repeat that pattern with their own subordinates and become exceptional leaders of their teams,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;Our study sheds light on a silver lining of sorts for people who are subjected to abuse at work. Some managers who experience this abuse can reframe their experience so it doesn't reflect their behavior and actually makes them better leaders.&quot;</p>
<p>The study found those who relied on their morals and integrity to defy their manager's abusive approach felt encouraged to prevent it from moving beyond their bosses.</p>
<p>Through multiple experiments over several years, the researchers examined the differences in attitude and behavior of supervisors who had been abused by superiors and those who had not and, in turn, how each group treated their employees. They found that abused supervisors who purposefully distanced themselves from their manager expressed respect and kindness toward their own employees, despite the poor treatment they received from their own boss.</p>
<p>&quot;The lesson here isn't to hire more abusive managers, of course, but to try to encourage people who have been abused, among other things, to say, 'Look, I'm not like my boss,'&quot; Taylor said. &quot;You can take a stand -- not just by reporting the bad behavior, but by actively rejecting this abusive leadership style.&quot;</p>
<p>Taylor said he doesn't expect workplace abuse to disappear, but he notes that companies are learning and trying to solve the problem through training and maintaining positive workplace climates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>abstract</em> Studies show that abusive leader behaviors “trickle down” to lower organizational levels, but this research ignores that many abused supervisors do not perpetuate abuse by harming their own subordinates. Drawing on social-cognitive theory and related research, we suggest abused supervisors might defy rather than emulate their managers’ abusive behavior. Specifically, we predicted that some abused supervisors—namely, those with strong moral identities—might in effect “change course” by engaging in less abuse or demonstrating ethical leadership with their subordinates to the extent they disidentify with their abusive managers. Across 2 experiments (n = 288 and 462 working adults, respectively) and a field study (n = 500 employees and their supervisors), we show that relations between manager abuse and supervisors’ abusive and ethical behaviors were carried by supervisors’ disidentification, and that the direct and indirect effects of manager abuse were stronger for supervisors with comparatively higher moral identity levels.</p>

<li>question of “if gandhi was so great, why were his family not also?” leave aside truth of whether statement about gandhi or family is true, what is speaker saying? he says “if X is good, why is Y, which is associated with X, not also good?”
<ul>
<li>a similar type of question is “if X can do Z, and Z is good, why does X not do so?”</li>

<li>divide and conquer
<ul>
<li>they try to teach us to isolate ourselves, so that we become easier for them to manipulate — when we are encouraged to turn away from someone just because they do not share all our current opinions, we end up turning away everybody. this is how they at once unite and divide us — united in our loneliness and fear and striking at the enemies our abusers choose for us, and divided to stop us opposing their abuse</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>purity, sanctity, perfection, eternity, disgust, hatred, fear, evil, immutability: these are all things abusers wish us to believe in so they can take our power.
<ul>
<li>to make us believe in evil is necessary concept if the abusers want us to believe we are powerless, that they are the only saviours who can rescue us, that we must trust and believe in them.</li>
<li>abusers created the concept of evil. people's belief in evil helps abusers control and manipulate them, to make them slaves and pawns in wars against other abusers.</li>

<ul>
<li>the difference between intentional abusers and everybody else is: they want to perpetuate abuse, rather than want love to replace abuse.</li>
<li>what is love? in the simplest words, that is what it is — wishing better for all, rather than worse.</li>
<li>to live lovingly, we must confront abuse of others and within ourselves. let us speak today of some ways to live lovingly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00520</h2>
<ul>
<li>whether abuse of resources, influence or omission — the abuse must stop</li>
<li>this is how you can spot abusers, because their influence is in one direction only, to perpetuate myths and lies that force people into false certainty, rather than to cherish diversity and the living, changing, reality of life.</li>
<li>why can it difficult to deal with abusive people? unfortunately they have different understanding of what is reasonable; by definition they are acting selfishly when we would expect them to be more considerate. unless we know they have a history of being abusive, we might not trust our judgement that they are abusive — in effect we are treating them as we would like to be treated, as a normal person who may just have some problems. unfortunately when we deal with an abusive person, they are unlike a normal person and treating them with consideration does not produce a good result. they will take advantage of your kindness, not because they are evil but because they they don't know how to behave better. so to preserve our sanity we need to communicate with them in a way they will understand. there may not be an easy way to do this as each person who acts abusively is abusive in their own way and to communicate you will need to understand their version of reality. one way is to say, &quot;that was mean,&quot; after they do something mean.
<ul>
<li>with responsible people this is much easier, because responsible people bring their own resources and act to understand your version of reality too; they are team players who play their part in a two–way communication. with an abusive person, the effort is only one way.</li>
<li>how do we determine if a person is abusive or not? you can see if they are abusive by their actions. everything they do will point towards their version of reality, and show how it may be distorted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>00420</h2>
<ul>
<li>we too act abusively sometimes, in some places, even if unknowingly or without understanding we do.</li>
<li>as we all hold some beliefs that we have not examined, so we are all that part abusive. this is no idealism, no dream — it is why we all must do our bit, and those who intentionally do not do their bit are abusers.</li>
<li>there is only a very small difference between abusive and responsible behaviour — some people do not want to face the reality that they also sometimes behave abusively, but that does not mean reality does not exist</li>
<li>because it is especially difficult for people to understand how we ourselves are being abusive, one useful way of learning is by trying to understand how others are being abusive, and then applying that understanding to our own behaviour</li>
</ul>
<h2>00320</h2>
<ul>
<li>it may seem at times that abusers have the advantage — especially at individual level, where small numbers of abusers can use concentration of power in our societal systems to abuse in a way that magnifies and multiplies the effect of abuse.</li>
<li>but that is only part of reality. there are ways of being that can mitigate and dissolve that seeming advantage, and may provide us with seeming advantages of our own. among these ways is diversification — to shift power from concentration–of–power by changing the “concentration” process. another path we call “succession”, or “change” — renewal through death and birth, which also shifts power from individual abusers in some ways.</li>
</ul>
<h2>00220</h2>
<ul>
<li>they all derive their authority from an appearance of certainty. this is why they cannot deal with anything that challenges that illusion, as they would lose their authority and thus their livelihood.</li>

<h2>00120</h2>

<li>
<p>I hope this will be an easy read for you, for in our time, our culture had not developed far enough, and it would have been a very difficult read for most people.</p>
<p>I hope in your time the abusers are not so powerful as they were in ours, that you can learn without oppression, or perhaps that oppression and abuse are more recognisable to you than it was to us, so that you can avoid or deal with it more easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>imagine you are reading this a thousand years in the future. who are they teaching you to hate? who do they accuse of abuse? what do they try to hide from you, and why? is the locked door they say is to keep you safe, in fact a prison to keep you contained?</p>
