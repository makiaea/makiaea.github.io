<p><em>a story of gains and losses: intra-individual shifts in job characteristics and well-being when transitioning to a managerial role</em><br />
maike e. debus et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10869-018-9604-3">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10869-018-9604-3</a></p>

<p>The study, recently published in the Journal of Business and Psychology, examined more than 2,000 individuals and found that employees experienced so-called resource gains and losses when they became managers.</p>
<p>Charlotte Fritz, a co-author of the study and an associate professor of industrial and organizational psychology in PSU's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, said the increased authority and freedom that comes with a managerial role leads to an increase in job satisfaction.</p>
<p>But on the flip side, having to juggle a heavier workload means having to potentially skip breaks or work longer hours. As a result, managers experience higher levels of exhaustion and more work-family conflict, Fritz said.</p>
<p>The study builds on research that has shown that an employee's ability to detach from work during non-work hours is important for their well-being and results in lower burnout and higher life satisfaction.</p>
<p>Fritz recommends that companies not only restructure managers' work so they're not dealing with constant time pressure, but also incorporate strategies for detachment as part of management trainings.</p>
<p>&quot;Organizations need to encourage managers to regularly take time to mentally let go of work -- to not check emails, to not be on calls at home, to actively engage with their families or hobbies -- so the impact on exhaustion and work-family conflict is not as strong,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>She said it's as much about employees' well-being as it is about the company's bottom line. The cost of sick leave or replacing employees who leave in search of a better work-life balance can be expensive.</p>
<p>&quot;Supervisors are responsible for others and if they're burned out or not satisfied in their role and their work, that trickles down,&quot; Fritz said. &quot;They're not only impacting themselves on an individual level; they're impacting a whole workgroup. Managers are highly influential in terms of employees' work experiences, so they need to be taken care of.&quot;</p>
<p>But she said there is a movement happening.</p>
<p>&quot;There are organizations who are getting it,&quot; Fritz said. &quot;They're creating flexibility for their employees about where and when to work, allowing them to create boundaries and encouraging supervisors to support their employees around creating work-life balance.&quot;</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> Building on conservation of resources theory, we examined the duality inherent in one of the most significant work-related transitions an employee may go through: becoming a manager. Specifically, we explored intra-individual resource gains (i.e., increases in participation in decision-making) and resource losses (i.e., increases in time pressure) and their associations with intra-individual shifts in well-being (i.e., job satisfaction, exhaustion, and work-to-family conflict) when employees transitioned to a managerial position. In addition, we examined whether new managers’ perceived ability to detach from work during nonwork time moderated these processes. Multilevel analyses among 2052 individuals demonstrated that individuals experienced both a resource gain and a loss when they became managers. As expected, there was an indirect effect of the transition to a managerial position to an increase in job satisfaction via an increase in participation in decision-making. Additionally, there were indirect effects of the transition to a managerial position to an increase in both exhaustion and work-to-family conflict via an increase in time pressure. In line with the hypotheses, we found that new managers who perceived that they were able to detach well experienced a weaker increase in exhaustion and work-to-family conflict (as transmitted via an increase in time pressure). Contrary to the hypothesis, perceived ability to detach reduced the increase in job satisfaction (as transmitted via an increase in participation in decision-making). Our findings shed light on the intra-individual processes that occur when employees become managers, indicating that this transition can be a “double-edged sword.”</p>

<li>there are things that you can do, while you are still able to (this doesn’t mean you are better, there are things that we are each only able to do) — don’t give too much time to waiting for others to join you, though knowing you, you will anyway — your time is short, do what you can, while you still can</li>

<li>after a while, we do just have to understand that people can only go as far as they can go, which is not anyone’s fault, it arises from our circumstances. but it is healthier for us not to expect anybody, including us, to go beyond what we can, and work around this.</li>
<li>if someone isn’t ready to see that as something we need to prepare for, or they only think they are right, and thus have no work to do, then we have to understand this is as far as they can go, and move on without them.</li>

<li>blame and forgiveness and responsibility are illusions too, so although it is useful to try to avoid people who act abusively, using any more resources than that on any particular abuser or group is not very useful in the long term. these are illusions because we do not truly know or choose what we do, the power of the beliefs, the illusions that bind us is such that we rarely truly make a decision in full consciousness, in which we can be truly responsible.</li>
<li>because we are all “mentally ill” or “abusive” in this way, because there are always things we do that are beyond our even partial comprehension, no matter whether we know this or not, we ought not to demonise those who act abusively, because we are those very same people — whether we know it or not.</li>

<li>there are very few people who were born with no conscience. you are not one of those people. have the courage to admit you were wrong, and make amends. you can do it.</li>
<li>when we are young or vulnerable, we might ask what is a good path in life?</li>
<li>just as for power or fame or words, only those that do not or no longer need them are the ones who can truly handle them.</li>
<li>everybody has to step up to the plate and do the thing they can do. (plate is Americanism for batter's plate in baseball)</li>
<li>it is possible, though uncommon, to be powerful and stay responsible.</li>
<li>life is no less difficult when you have solved major obstacles. being able to solve problems means you are asked and are able to solve more.</li>

<ul>
<li>it is a missing personal sense of responsibility which leads people to make such an awful world. when abusers use the power of institutions to manipulate or destroy people’s sense of responsibility, they desecrate our lives, our society and our planet.</li>
<li>what can we do, when we cannot rely on institutions or leaders to deal with reality responsibly? we must each discover, and maintain together, our shared responsibilty, our duty to the world, our embedded symbiosis with nature.</li>
<li>cause and effect are asymmetric, we never see the direct consequences of our actions because we believe, however wrongly, that our one small action does not contribute significantly to the overall effect. and when by chance the consequences come to roost on us, there is no one we can really blame (although we often believe we can) because it is the piecemeal conglomeration of many actions which resulted in the awful result for us this time.</li>
<li>how then, to evaluate, to choose how to behave? it is not a matter of each individual action that we should fuss over, but the overall trend of our behaviour. does our behaviour tend to be benign, or is it more abusive than we realise at first? what process can we implement, what next steps should we take, to understand better the abusiveness of our behaviour and ameliorate some of that abuse? sadly, currently most people have never really understood this far, because they are so far buried beneath the accumulated wreckage of humanity’s collective abusive behaviour that they never get to realise it.</li>
<li>instead of understanding that we are all under some delusions, almost all people instead believe that they are the sole bearers of the truth. in the past this did not matter so much, because although people did cause immense harm, most people did not live long enough or have enough power to destroy too much themselves, nor were there too many people that had such power. this is no longer the case, for by the use of fossil and other fuels, and by mechanisms of culture such as belief and manipulation, people have destroyed the processes that circulated the world’s power in a harmonious form — people have, in other words, corrupted the power of the natural world.</li>
