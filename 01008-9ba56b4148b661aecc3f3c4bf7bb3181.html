<p>starry, starry night<br />
paint your palette blue and gray<br />
look out on a summer’s day<br />
with eyes that know the darkness in my soul<br />
shadows on the hills<br />
sketch the trees and daffodils<br />
catch the breeze and winter chills<br />
in colours on the snowy linen land<br />
　<br />
now I understand<br />
what you tried to say to me<br />
and how you suffered for your sanity<br />
how you tried to set them free<br />
they would not listen, they did not know how<br />
perhaps they’ll listen now<br />
　<br />
starry, starry night<br />
flaming flowers brightly blaze<br />
swirling clouds in violet haze<br />
reflect in Vincent’s eyes of china blue<br />
colours changing hue<br />
morning fields of amber grain<br />
weathered faces lined in pain<br />
are soothed beneath the artist’s loving hand<br />
　<br />
now I understand<br />
what you tried to say to me<br />
and how you suffered for your sanity<br />
how you tried to set them free<br />
they would not listen, they did not know how<br />
perhaps they’ll listen now<br />
　<br />
though they could not love you<br />
still your love was true<br />
and when no hope was left inside<br />
on that starry, starry night<br />
you took your leave<br />
as lovers often do<br />
but i want to tell you Vincent<br />
such a world did not deserve<br />
one as beautiful as you<br />
　<br />
starry, starry night<br />
portraits hang in empty halls<br />
frameless heads on nameless walls<br />
eyes that saw a world and could not forget<br />
strangers we/ll met<br />
ragged men in ragged clothes<br />
silver thorned bloody rose<br />
lies crushed and broken on the virgin snow<br />
　<br />
now I think I know<br />
what you tried to say to me<br />
and how you suffered for your sanity<br />
how you tried to set them free<br />
they would not listen<br />
they’re not listening still<br />
perhaps they never will<br />
　<br />
starry, starry night<br />
pastel ribbonned parasols<br />
bloom as drifts of acid fall<br />
like mist upon the cherries in the spring<br />
do you them sing<br />
even as the lions maul<br />
in answer to a higher call<br />
real<br />
　<br />
now we truly feel<br />
what you tried to help us see<br />
and how you suffered through your sanity<br />
how you tried to set us free<br />
we did not listen, we would not learn how<br />
perhaps we’ll listen now</p>
