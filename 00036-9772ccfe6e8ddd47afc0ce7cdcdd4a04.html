<ul>
<li>Naturalistic environments have been demonstrated to promote relaxation and wellbeing. We assess opposing theoretical accounts for these effects through investigation of autonomic arousal and alterations of activation and functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) of the brain while participants listened to sounds from artificial and natural environments. We found no evidence for increased DMN activity in the naturalistic compared to artificial or control condition, however, seed based functional connectivity showed a shift from anterior to posterior midline functional coupling in the naturalistic condition. These changes were accompanied by an increase in peak high frequency heart rate variability, indicating an increase in parasympathetic activity in the naturalistic condition in line with the Stress Recovery Theory of nature exposure. Changes in heart rate and the peak high frequency were correlated with baseline functional connectivity within the DMN and baseline parasympathetic tone respectively, highlighting the importance of individual neural and autonomic differences in the response to nature exposure. Our findings may help explain reported health benefits of exposure to natural environments, through identification of alterations to autonomic activity and functional coupling within the DMN when listening to naturalistic sounds.</li>

<p>my ears are likely no different to most people, but the recall, the remaking of sounds in my brain is likely to be unusual. just as we can all recognise sounds by the barest hints of the actual sound, it may be that my internal experience of music and sound is greatly influenced by the development of my ability in recognising and reconstructing sounds. so although the input through the ears is the same as most people, the interpretation of the input is different. this is as I expect it should be for everyone, just that we do not appreciate it. this may have bearing on why i can frisson at will — the interpretation can hook in to what is believed for most people to be an involuntary response.</p>

<p><em>anatomically distinct dopamine release during anticipation and experience of peak emotion to music</em><br />

<li>Music, an abstract stimulus, can arouse feelings of euphoria and craving, similar to tangible rewards that involve the striatal dopaminergic system. Using the neurochemical specificity of [11C]raclopride positron emission tomography scanning, combined with psychophysiological measures of autonomic nervous system activity, we found endogenous dopamine release in the striatum at peak emotional arousal during music listening. To examine the time course of dopamine release, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging with the same stimuli and listeners, and found a functional dissociation: the caudate was more involved during the anticipation and the nucleus accumbens was more involved during the experience of peak emotional responses to music. These results indicate that intense pleasure in response to music can lead to dopamine release in the striatal system. Notably, the anticipation of an abstract reward can result in dopamine release in an anatomical pathway distinct from that associated with the peak pleasure itself. Our results help to explain why music is of such high value across all human societies.</li>

<li>Humans uniquely appreciate aesthetics, experiencing pleasurable responses to complex stimuli that confer no clear intrinsic value for survival. However, substantial variability exists in the frequency and specificity of aesthetic responses. While pleasure from aesthetics is attributed to the neural circuitry for reward, what accounts for individual differences in aesthetic reward sensitivity remains unclear. Using a combination of survey data, behavioral and psychophysiological measures and diffusion tensor imaging, we found that white matter connectivity between sensory processing areas in the superior temporal gyrus and emotional and social processing areas in the insula and medial prefrontal cortex explains individual differences in reward sensitivity to music. Our findings provide the first evidence for a neural basis of individual differences in sensory access to the reward system, and suggest that social–emotional communication through the auditory channel may offer an evolutionary basis for music making as an aesthetically rewarding function in humans.</li>

<li>It is a common experience—and well established experimentally—that music can engage us emotionally in a compelling manner. The mechanisms underlying these experiences are receiving increasing scrutiny. However, the extent to which other domains of aesthetic experience can similarly elicit strong emotions is unknown. Using psychophysiology, neuroimaging and behavioral responses, we show that recited poetry can act as a powerful stimulus for eliciting peak emotional responses, including chills and objectively measurable goosebumps that engage the primary reward circuitry. Importantly, while these responses to poetry are largely analogous to those found for music, their neural underpinnings show important differences, specifically with regard to the crucial role of the nucleus accumbens. We also go beyond replicating previous music-related studies by showing that peak aesthetic pleasure can co-occur with physiological markers of negative affect. Finally, the distribution of chills across the trajectory of poems provides insight into compositional principles of poetry.</li>

<p><em>more than a feeling: autonomous sensory meridian response (asmr) is characterized by reliable changes in affect and physiology</em><br />
giulia lara poerio, emma blakey, thomas j. hostler, theresa veltri 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196645">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196645</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) describes the experience of tingling sensations in the crown of the head, in response to a range of audio-visual triggers such as whispering, tapping, and hand movements. Public interest in ASMR has risen dramatically and ASMR experiencers watch ASMR videos to promote relaxation and sleep. Unlike ostensibly similar emotional experiences such as “aesthetic chills” from music and awe-inspiring scenarios, the psychological basis of ASMR has not yet been established. We present two studies (one large-scale online experiment; one laboratory study) that test the emotional and physiological correlates of the ASMR response. Both studies showed that watching ASMR videos increased pleasant affect only in people who experienced ASMR. Study 2 showed that ASMR was associated with reduced heart rate and increased skin conductance levels. Findings indicate that ASMR is a reliable and physiologically-rooted experience that may have therapeutic benefits for mental and physical health.</li>

<p>there is no getting around the fact that anything that challenges their illusion of reality will be seen as a threat; that is part of the way threat is defined. so when friends reject what you know, because they see it as threat, don't take it as them rejecting you (even though it is); rather, they do not yet see a difference between what you know and who you are, so they are not rejecting you intentionally.</p>
<p>most people assume that who you are, how you behave, depends on what you know. to begin with, this might seem true, but as you learn beyond this assumption, you will find that what you know no longer determines who you are.</p>
<p>or maybe there are other &quot;rules&quot; that could describe how what we know shows who we are, but they are not the simple rules people mostly rely on; i don't know what those other rules are.</p>
<p>ordinarily i don't seem to think much about who i am. but i do register it when people reject me for what they think i am. maybe i don't think about it much because i no longer find it as useful a concept as i used to (i probably did find it useful for some time).</p>

<li>and the answer is very similar — that which we are best able to contribute. while for some, this might an unusual idea, in reality it has been there all along.</li>
<li>seems like an unusual question to ask — and that, concisely, is why it must be asked. each person ultimately contributes to society what they can, and the best contribution is that which only that person is able to do, among all other people.</li>

<li>successful navigation
<ul>
<li>we are sometimes not appreciated because we can explain things in such a way as to make them seem like common sense. but we know that this is actually the hardest thing to do, even as we aim to make it easier for people to do. so, like a soothsayer whose warnings are heeded, because they are successful, tragedy is averted but their reward is a quiet life, not fame for a disaster averted because people don't remember things in that way.</li>
<li>navigating is like leading a blindfolded person. the leader charts the course and the blindfolded person only knows of the obstacles when they hit them, that is, when they are not successfully avoided.</li>
<li>if the person persists in wearing a blindfold, then they will never appreciate the effort of the leader who successfully navigates past obstacles.</li>

<p><em>showing ability</em><br />
we have abilities but don’t show them often; this is not shyness or modesty, it is a direct consequence of abilities that are diverse, and so not required often, abilities that are not easily understood, and so not appreciated when seen by others, abilities that are deal with rare situations, and these situations do not occur often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>doctors, dentists, scientists, people all rely on their general models of what people are like in order to interact with you. if you are very different from that model, they are unlikely to understand or appreciate you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but that does not mean you should lose hope. there are people who will appreciate you, you just need to meet many more people before you might find them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not appreciating people and nature for what they are and what they do, this is the heart of our civilisational error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people do not appreciate what they have when they do not understand what they have</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if people don't think you are important enough for their consideration, they are mistaken, but that does not mean their actions do not affect your opportunities. but how you react to their abuse is within your control. i wasted twenty years trying to reform civilisation, one person at a time. now i understand that we need to create a new one, which everyone can join if they really want to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>because we learn many more different kinds of things than most people, we cannot expect them to understand our learning process — for example, that many skills will be at a level “inferior” to specialised skills for a long while, simply because they are not yet needed, but once they are assigned priority, we can ramp them up, that is “improve” them, much more rapidly than most people; not because of some “genius ability” but simply by the way we choose to do things.</p>

<li>humankind like a cloud: delicate and wispy yet capable of huge changes like a thunderstorm. also has meaning in the way that rain has meaning; it is needed, and essential but no part is more needed or essential than another.</li>

<li>to love is to learn, to share, to thrive —it is what we are meant to do.</li>
<li>we might sometimes wonder, “what am i doing here? if i cannot change the world then what is the point?” but by just doing what you do every day, you are already changing the world. this is the reality of diversity, that our many possibilities make our future, the possibilities that we make possible by living each day, in ways that we cannot even imagine.</li>
