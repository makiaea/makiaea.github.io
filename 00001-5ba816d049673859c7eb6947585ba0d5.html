<li>pot calling kettle black: in the days of smoky fires, soot stuck to the cooking utensils, and a pot would be as black as the kettle. in recent history, this phrase meant that the pot should not call the kettle dirty, as it was dirty itself. but it can also mean that the pot has some understanding of what it is to be blackened by soot, so is well prepared to understand the blackening on the kettle.</li>

<li>by understanding the tools and skills we use, and maintaining them and questioning them, we can better understand the reality we create for ourselves</li>

<ul>
<li>how to learn what we need to know when we don’t even know what it is we need to know.</li>
<li>if you are interested in enlightenment, in responsibility, it would seem that my research is about ways how we can become enlightened or responsible. if you aren’t much interested in those things, then what i research would not seem very interesting to you.</li>
<li>it doesn’t matter where you start; just start.</li>
<li>if you are interested in diversity or evolution, you will be interested to know that the fundamental question that evolution answers is exactly analagous to “how to learn what we need to know when we don’t even know what it is we need to know”.</li>
<li>and because the fundamental condition is that “we cannot know what it is that we need to know, because we cannot see the future”, the answer is that everything matters; it is a form of diversity, a preparation for the future.</li>
<li>by having many possible options that we can develop, some of which may, though we do not know it, be more suitable to current and future conditions, it makes perpetuating and flourishing more possible.</li>
<li>if the world needs this book, if you need this book, i hope you found it in time. if you are reading this and understand it, then you probably had a really tough time so far. i wish it were true that what is in this book was already commonly understood; maybe it was once, and maybe, with your help, one day it will be again.</li>
<li>where we’re going, it’s even tougher; there are no instruction manuals, and this isn’t one. it’s one person’s notes on where we think we’ve been and where we might be headed.</li>

<ul>
<li>on thriving in diversity: beyond the limits on knowledge, understanding, and action</li>
<li>If we've been able to communicate through this book, you know and understand that flourishing is a process that comes not from an individual, but from a group, a culture, a superorganism, and also that we must choose and act, in reality to live in flourishing.</li>
<li>understanding that we have limits to our knowledge, we can try to go beyond those limits by learning what we do not know, and what we cannot know.</li>
<li>understanding that we have limits to our understanding, we can try to go beyond those limits by reflecting upon our understanding and reexamining what we believe, and what we cannot understand.</li>
<li>understanding that we have limits to our ability to act, we can try to go beyond those limits by living and acting together in groups and societies and superorganisms, and letting our diversity help us flourish in an uncertain world.</li>

<li>
<p>you've probably heard of the famous greek philosophers, socrates, plato and aristotle. but there were some who did not chase fame, but are remembered nonetheless, and one of those was diogenes. why did notable people go out of their way to disparage him and his entire school of thought? is it because something he and his school stood for challenged the basis of their lives?</p>
<p>what if fame and fortune were not all that they are talked up to be? well, diogenes had some idea about that. although almost all that we know about him and his school is conjecture, we can piece together something interesting from the way the conjecture was made.</p>
