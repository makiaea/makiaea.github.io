<p>“the Balinese extend to human relationships attitudes based upon bodily balance, and that they generalize the idea that motion is essential to balance. This last point gives us, I believe, a partial answer to the question of why the society not only continues to function but functions rapidly and busily, continually undertaking ceremonial and artistic tasks which are not economically or competitively determined. This steady state is maintained by continual nonprogressive change.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“in general the contexts which recur in Balinese social life preclude cumulative interaction and that childhood experience trains the child away from seeking climax in personal interaction; it was shown that certain positive values—related to balance—recur in the culture and are incorporated into the character structure during child-hood, and, further, that these values may be specifically related to the steady state”</p>

<p>The economics of the system, in fact, pushes organisms toward sinking into the unconscious those generalities of relationship which remain permanently true and toward keeping within the conscious the pragmatics of particular instances.<br />
The premises may, economically, be sunk, but particular conclusions must be conscious. But the “sinking,” though economical, is still done at a price—the price of inaccessibility. Since the level to which things are sunk is characterized by iconic algorithms and metaphor, it becomes difficult for the organism to examine the matrix out or which his conscious conclusions spring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all organisms must be content with rather little consciousness, and that if consciousness has any useful functions whatever (which has never been demonstrated but is probably true), then economy in consciousness will be of the first importance. No organism can afford to be conscious of matters with which it could deal at unconscious levels.<br />
This is the economy achieved by habit formation.</p>

<p><em>the role of intrusive imagery in hoarding disorder</em><br />
nick a.j. stewart et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beth.2019.04.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beth.2019.04.005</a></p>

<p>It was already known that hoarding behaviour is driven by a strong emotional connection with objects. But the new experimental findings, published online in the journal Behavior Therapy, show that for people who hoard this connection may be in part attributable to the vivid, positive memories associated with those objects.</p>
<p>In essence, for those with hoarding problems, individual items become an extension of a given memory, becoming a barrier to decluttering and hence exacerbating an individual's problems. Drawing on the new findings, the team behind the study hope that cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for hoarding might be enhanced by training individuals to respond differently to those memories.</p>
<p>Hoarding describes a problem where individuals have considerable difficulty letting go of possessions. Consequently, rooms can become so cluttered over time that living spaces becomes no longer usable for their intended purpose.</p>
<p>According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, hoarding can be a mental health problem in its own right (known as 'hoarding disorder'). The clutter associated with hoarding can have profound negative effects on the lives of people living with the problem and those around them, particularly with respect to emotional and physical well-being, health and safety, and finances. The fire risks associated with clutter are also be of particular concern.</p>
<p>Lead researcher Dr Nick Stewart, who now works as a Clinical Psychologist at Avon &amp; Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust, explains: &quot;People who hoard are often offered CBT to help them understand the thoughts and feelings associated with their saving and acquiring behaviours. This approach is very beneficial for some people, but not all. Our aim is to understand better the psychological factors that drive hoarding behaviour, to give us clues for how therapy for hoarding might be improved.&quot;</p>
<p>The researchers conducted structured interviews with 27 people with clinically-significant hoarding problems, and 28 without such difficulties (the 'control' group).</p>
<p>Participants were asked to recall the memories that came to mind the last time they discarded, or tried to discard, items at home.</p>
<p>Both groups reported positive memories while discarding possessions that they valued (which may describe most possessions in the case of people who hoard). These memories included recollections of acquiring the object, or memories of an event or person associated with the object. Crucially, the control participants (those without a hoarding problem) reported attempts to avoid this positive imagery, while the hoarding participants did not.</p>
<p>Dr Stewart explains: &quot;We can all relate to the experience of being flooded with positive memories when we hold valued possessions in our hands. However, our findings suggest that it's the way in which we respond to these object-related memories that dictates whether we hold onto an object or let it go. The typical population appears to be able to set aside these memories, presumably to ease the task of discarding the objects, and so manage to avoid the accumulation of clutter. The hoarding participants enjoyed the positive memories but reported that they got in the way of their attempts to discard objects.&quot;</p>
<p>In the paper, the researchers have suggested ways in which this new insight could be used to enhance CBT for hoarding.</p>
<p>Dr James Gregory, Clinical Research Tutor and Clinical Psychologist at the University of Bath, who supervised the research, said: &quot;Where positive memories, and the mental images associated with them, are getting in the way of discarding objects, therapists could work with people to develop an alternative image to 'compete' with the one that's causing difficulty. This competing image could capture the positive consequences of discarding items, for example, eating a meal with loved ones at a dinner table once it is clear of possessions.&quot;</p>
<p>The next step is a follow-on experimental study to see if helping people to 'rescript' memories in this way is helpful for enabling people to let go of objects more easily.</p>

<p><em>abstract</em> •This is the first study to investigate intrusive imagery in Hoarding Disorder.<br />
•Hoarding individuals report intrusive imagery that impedes discarding.<br />
•Imagery-based interventions may prove useful for treating Hoarding Disorder.</p>
<p>Despite the incidence of trauma in the histories of people with Hoarding Disorder (HD), reexperiencing symptoms, namely intrusive images, have not been investigated in the condition. To address this, 27 individuals who met DSM-5 criteria for HD and 28 community controls (CCs) were interviewed about (a) their everyday experiences of intrusive imagery, and (b) the unexpected images they experience when discarding high- and low-value possessions. Compared to CCs, everyday images described by the HD group were more frequent, had a greater negative valence, and were associated with greater interference in everyday life and attempts to avoid the imagery. With regard to discard-related imagery, a MANOVA followed up with mixed ANOVAs showed that HD participants reported more negative experiences of intrusive imagery in comparison with CCs during recent episodes of discarding objects of low subjective value. However, HD and CC participants both experienced positive imagery when discarding high-value objects. CC participants reported greater avoidance of imagery in the high-value object condition, but imagery-avoidance did not change between conditions for HD participants. The findings are discussed, particularly in relation to the potential of imagery-based interventions for HD.</p>

<li>Recent developments have for the first time allowed the determination of three-dimensional structures of individual chromosomes and genomes in nuclei of single haploid mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells based on Hi–C chromosome conformation contact data. Although these first structures have a relatively low resolution, they provide the first experimental data that can be used to study chromosome and intact genome folding. Here we further analyze these structures and provide the first evidence that G1 phase chromosomes are knotted, consistent with the fact that plots of contact probability vs sequence separation show a power law dependence that is intermediate between that of a fractal globule and an equilibrium structure.</li>

<p>The findings help explain how about 2 metres of DNA can be neatly packaged in each of our cells, in a space that is about the width of a hair.</p>
<p>Scientists have identified two sets of proteins in cells that work together to keep the strands unknotted, avoiding tangles that would hamper vital biological processes.</p>
<p>These proteins are found in many organisms, and scientists believe that their role in managing DNA may be common throughout nature.</p>
<p>One family of proteins -- known as SMC -- acts like a belay device used by rock climbers, which passes ropes through a series of loops.</p>
<p>These proteins have been found to work alongside another set, known as TopoII, which was previously thought to help solve tangles, but in a way that was not well understood.</p>
<p>Researchers at the Universities of Edinburgh and Padova in Italy studied the process by creating computer models of DNA with knots and links.</p>
<p>They found that SMC acts like a belay, sliding back and forth to enlarge or reduce loops in linked segments of DNA. Knots are first squeezed and compressed by SMC, and subsequently they are easily detected and resolved by TopoII.</p>
<p>Their study is the first to explain how the two families of proteins keep DNA tangle-free under the confined, crowded conditions of the cell. The research, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, was supported by the European Research Council.</p>
<p>Dr Davide Michieletto, of the University of Edinburgh's School of Physics and Astronomy, who led the study, said: &quot;DNA's long strands might be expected to become horribly tangled -- a bit like pulling knotted headphones out of your pocket. But instead, nature has created these amazing machines to address this problem in a remarkable way, seemingly across many species.&quot;</p>
</li>

<p><em>abstract</em> Topological entanglements severely interfere with important biological processes. For this reason, genomes must be kept unknotted and unlinked during most of a cell cycle. Type II topoisomerase (TopoII) enzymes play an important role in this process but the precise mechanisms yielding systematic disentanglement of DNA in vivo are not clear. Here we report computational evidence that structural-maintenance-of-chromosomes (SMC) proteins—such as cohesins and condensins—can cooperate with TopoII to establish a synergistic mechanism to resolve topological entanglements. SMC-driven loop extrusion (or diffusion) induces the spatial localization of essential crossings, in turn catalyzing the simplification of knots and links by TopoII enzymes even in crowded and confined conditions. The mechanism we uncover is universal in that it does not qualitatively depend on the specific substrate, whether DNA or chromatin, or on SMC processivity; we thus argue that this synergy may be at work across organisms and throughout the cell cycle.</p>

<p><em>impact of route choice and period of the day on cyclists’ exposure to black carbon in london, rotterdam and são paulo</em><br />
veronika sassen brand et al. 2019<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2019.03.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2019.03.007</a></p>

<p>black carbon levels cyclists are likely to be exposed to on heavily trafficked main routes in three major cities -- London (travelling to Liverpool Street), Rotterdam (travelling to Rotterdam Station) and São Paulo (travelling to Paulista Avenue). The scientists then compared this information with black carbon exposure on alternative routes between the same origin and destination that feature parks, waterways and other green infrastructure.</p>
<p>Overall, the results showed that the main routes in London and São Paulo exposed cyclists to higher concentrations of black carbon compared with alternative routes. In Rotterdam, concentration levels on main and alternative routes were similar.</p>
<p>The results also found that cyclists were exposed to twice as much black carbon levels on main routes in São Paulo compared to London and Rotterdam. Interestingly, Londoners cycling home on the main route during the evening commute were exposed to more pollutants than those who took the same route in the morning, and twice as much black carbon than those who took the alternative route.</p>
<p>Professor Prashant Kumar, Director of GCARE at the University of Surrey, said: &quot;While it is common sense to conclude that cyclists are at risk of potentially harmful exposure levels of black carbon, our study provides further evidence that cyclists should plan alternative routes during specific times. A slower, cleaner route home could make a dramatic impact on your exposure to harmful black carbon.</p>
<p>&quot;These findings should be considered when urban planners establish new cycle networks by increasing, as much as possible, the distance between the road and the cycle ways. This evidence also direct decision makers to seriously invest in green infrastructure throughout our major cities, as there is mounting evidence that these could provide the best line of defence against road pollution in near-road environments.&quot;</p>

<p>•Cyclists exposure assessment to BC in the cities of London, Rotterdam and São Paulo.<br />
•BC concentrations were higher in the morning-peak hours in São Paulo and Rotterdam.<br />
•In London, mean BC concentrations were higher during the evening peak hours.<br />
•Cyclists using the alternative routes were mostly less exposed to BC.<br />
•Important findings to consider in planning new cycle networks with lower exposure levels.</p>
<p>Cyclists are exposed to direct traffic emissions due to their proximity to on-road vehicles. Several studies associate black carbon (BC) exposure with both mortality and morbidity caused by cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. We did a comparative assessment of cyclists' exposure to BC in three cities: London, Rotterdam and São Paulo. We measured personal exposure to BC during the peak and off-peak hours in all three cities using the same instrument. Three origin-destination (O-D) pairs, each with two routes, for a total of six routes, were chosen in each city. The first route of each O-D pair was along busy major roads and the other perceived to be clean passing close to green/blue/quiet areas. This work brings together results from three different Latin American and European cities, with an aim to understand the BC exposure variabilities while cycling during peak and off-peak hours, identify main pollution hotspots resulting in enhanced exposure and associate the measured concentrations with proximity to green areas and waterways. BC concentrations were higher during the morning-peak hours compared with evening-peak hours in Rotterdam and São Paulo. London showed an opposite trend, with higher concentrations during evening hours. In most cases, the cyclists using the alternative route were found to be less exposed to BC in London and São Paulo. In Rotterdam, the differences in absolute concentrations between main and alternate routes were modest. Each city is different but the common features among all were that the exposure is related to route choice, a period of the day and proximity with the mobile sources. These findings have implications in terms of considering the pollutants exposure when establishing new cycle routes.</p>

<p><em>from the junkyard to the power grid: ambient processing of scrap metals into nanostructured electrodes for ultrafast rechargeable batteries</em><br />
nitin muralidharan et al. 2016<br />
<a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsenergylett.6b00295">acsenergylett.6b00295</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Here we present the first full cell battery device that is developed entirely from scrap metals of brass and steel—two of the most commonly used and discarded metals. A room-temperature chemical process is developed to convert brass and steel into functional electrodes for rechargeable energy storage that transforms these multicomponent alloys into redox-active iron oxide and copper oxide materials. The resulting steel–brass battery exhibits cell voltages up to 1.8 V, energy density up to 20 Wh/kg, power density up to 20 kW/kg, and stable cycling over 5000 cycles in alkaline electrolytes. Further, we show the versatility of this technique to enable processing of steel and brass materials of different shapes, sizes, and purity, such as screws and shavings, to produce functional battery components. The simplicity of this approach, building from chemicals commonly available in a household, enables a simple pathway to the local recovery, processing, and assembly of storage systems based on materials that would otherwise be discarded.</li>

<p><em>moringa oleifera seed protein adsorption to silica: effects of water hardness, fractionation, and fatty acid extraction</em><br />
brittany a. nordmark et al. 2018<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b00191">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b00191</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Motivated by the proposed use of cationic protein-modified sand for water filtration in developing nations, this study concerns the adsorption of <em>Moringa oleifera</em> seed proteins to silica surfaces. These proteins were prepared in model waters of varying hardness and underwent different levels of fractionation, including fatty acid extraction and cation exchange chromatography. Adsorption isotherms were measured by ellipsometry, and the zeta potentials of the resulting protein-decorated surfaces were measured by the rotating disk streaming potential method. The results indicate that the presence of fatty acids has little effect on the <em>M. oleifera</em> cationic protein adsorption isotherm. Adsorption from the unfractionated extract was indistinguishable from that of the cationic protein isolates at low concentrations but yielded significantly greater extents of adsorption at high concentrations. Adsorption isotherms for samples prepared in model hard and soft fresh waters were indistinguishable from each other over the measured bulk solution concentration range, but adsorption from hard or soft water was more extensive than adsorption from deionized water at moderate protein concentrations. Streaming potential measurements showed that adsorption reversed the net sign of the zeta potential of silica from negative to positive for all protein fractions and water hardness conditions at protein bulk concentrations as low as 0.03 μg/mL. This suggests that sands can be effectively modified with <em>M. oleifera</em> proteins using small amounts of seed extract under various local water hardness conditions. Finally, ellipsometry indicated that <em>M. oleifera</em> proteins adsorb irreversibly with respect to rinsing in these model fresh waters, suggesting that the modified sand would be stable on repeated use for water filtration. These studies may aid in the design of a simple, effective, and sustainable water purification device for developing nations.</li>

<li>For DIY Giant Bubbles you will need water (not hot, 4 tablespoons), dishwashing liquid (I used Fairy Green Apple, 2 tablespoons), 1 teaspoon of sugar, glycerin (for skin care, 2 tablespoons). Here you are! I used the top of Cola bottle as a tool for inflating bubbles (watch in my video tutorial). It is good for at-home fun. But for outdoor I used a regular cord (or rope) with 3 nuts to make it heavier (how to make it - you will find in my video). How long was the rope? About 150cm.<br />

<li>website for videos of techniques not of necessarily of experts' expertise but just ordinary people doing things we might not expect. like folding shirts quickly. youtube and the web are great but how do we find these things on them? what we need is a website that has the best in a categorised way to help us find this basic info that is hard to find otherwise. or a book if necessary. it would certainly be easier for me to write and maintain a book rather than a website. though having said this, isn't &quot;make&quot; just this kind of site? i guess the difference would be the type of content. ours would be like the swimming style and everything, curated by us.</li>

<p><em>cleaning by surfactant gradients: particulate removal from porous materials and the significance of rinsing in laundry detergency</em><br />
sangwoo shin et al. 2018<br />
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevapplied.9.034012">https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevapplied.9.034012</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Removing particles from fibrous materials involves loosening via surfactants followed by particle transfer in a flow. While flow advection is commonly believed to be the major driver for pore-scale transport, small pores within the fabric do not allow any significant fluid flow inside them, thus significantly reducing the role of advection. However, rinsing the fabric with fresh water naturally establishes a surfactant gradient within the pore space, providing a suitable environment for particles to undergo diffusiophoresis. We demonstrate that this mechanism can remove particles from deep within fabric pores at an accelerated rate. The nonlinear aspect of diffusiophoresis significantly prolongs the lifetime of the phoretic motion beyond the naive solute diffusion time scale during rinsing, allowing long-lasting, continuous removal of particles. Moreover, owing to the fine balance between chemiphoresis and electrophoresis for particles in anionic surfactant concentration gradients, we show that the particle removal is sensitive to the counterion mobility, suggesting a simple route to control the effect. We thus claim to have resolved the “stagnant core problem”—a long-standing mystery in laundry detergency—and have identified a physicochemical approach to particle transport in fibrous media with broad applicability.</li>
